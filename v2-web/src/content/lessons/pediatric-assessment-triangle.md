layout: lesson title: "Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT)" 
level: "All Levels" topic: "Pediatrics" duration: "30 minutes" 
summary: "The 30-second, hands-off assessment tool that tells you if a child is sick—or just having a bad day."

Arrival Scenario

You respond to a 10-month-old infant. Crying, irritable, fever of 102.5°F. The mother says he has a cold.

Before you touch the child, strap them down, or even look at a pulse ox, you need to know: Is this child compensating, or is a crash imminent?

The PAT is your first, best chance to get it right.

The PAT: Three Sides, Zero Hands

The Pediatric Assessment Triangle is done in 30 seconds or less, from the doorway, while the child is still in the parent’s arms.

1. Appearance (Tone, Interactiveness, Consolability, Look/Gaze, Speech/Cry)

This is the most critical side. It reflects the status of the child's brain function and oxygenation/ventilation.

Finding

Interpretation

Normal

Awake, playful, alert, consolable by parent, good tone

Abnormal

Lethargic, limp, poor muscle tone, unconsolable, abnormal gaze (stare), poor fluid speech/cry

Clinical Pearl: The most sensitive sign of pediatric illness is altered mental status. A quiet, floppy child is far sicker than a screaming, fighting child.

2. Work of Breathing (WOB)

This side assesses the efficiency of the airway and pulmonary mechanics.

Finding

Interpretation

Normal

Quiet, comfortable breathing

Abnormal

Nasal flaring, retractions (subcostal, supraclavicular), audible noise (grunting, stridor, wheezing), tripod position, head bobbing (infants)

Key Warning: Grunting (exhaling against a closed glottis) is an attempt to create PEEP. It is a sign of severe respiratory distress or failure. Treat this as a red flag.

3. Circulation to Skin

This reflects the status of perfusion and cardiac output.

Finding

Interpretation

Normal

Pink, warm, cap refill < 2 seconds

Abnormal

Pale, mottled, ashen, cyanotic

Clinical Pearl: Peripheral vasoconstriction (pale/mottled) is the child's first attempt to compensate for shock. This is compensated shock until proven otherwise.

Pattern Recognition: Combining the Sides

The power of the PAT is in the pattern, not the individual score.

Pattern

Category

Interpretation

A $\downarrow$, WOB $\uparrow$, C $\downarrow$

Cardiopulmonary Failure

IMMINENT ARREST. Child has failed both respiratory and circulatory compensation.

A $\downarrow$, WOB Normal, C $\downarrow$

Shock (Compensated/Decompensated)

Fluid/perfusion issue (septic, hypovolemic, cardiogenic). Treat fluids/pressors.

A Normal, WOB $\uparrow$, C Normal

Respiratory Distress

Early failure. Needs O2, positioning, medications (nebs/CPAP).

A $\downarrow$, WOB $\uparrow$, C Normal

Respiratory Failure

Fatigue setting in. Needs BVM/intubation now.

A $\downarrow$, WOB Normal, C Normal

CNS/Metabolic

Brain is sick but pump/lungs are fine (TBI, seizure, DKA, hypoglycemia, tox).

PAT Anchor: If the Appearance is abnormal, the child is sick and requires immediate, aggressive intervention.

Tactical Management

PAT Triage Priority

If A $\downarrow$ and WOB $\uparrow$ (Respiratory Failure): Airway first. Intubation is likely. You have minutes before fatigue leads to arrest.

If A $\downarrow$ and C $\downarrow$ (Shock): Circulation first. IV/IO access immediately, rapid fluid bolus (20 mL/kg).

If WOB $\uparrow$ (Distress): Supportive Care. Position, O2, nebulizers, reassess.

PAT-Driven Decision Checklist

Lethargy/Floppy: CHECK GLUCOSE. Immediate Dextrose (D10 2mL/kg) if low.

Tripoding/Silence: PREPARE AIRWAY. Intubation setup and drugs ready.

Mottling/Cap Refill > 3s: FLUID BOLUS. Get IO/IV and run 20 mL/kg NS/LR.

Bradycardia ($\downarrow$ HR): In a child, this is usually HYPOXIA. Ventilate first, then drugs.

Practice Cases

Case 1: The Quiet Kid

PAT Findings:

Appearance: Lethargic, poor tone, not consolable.

WOB: Shallow, slow (RR 16). No retractions.

Circulation: Pale, cool extremities, cap refill 4 seconds.

Vitals: HR 55, BP 60/p, BG 85.

Diagnosis and Action:

Diagnosis: Cardiopulmonary Failure (leading to Bradycardia) from severe compensated shock that has turned critical. The low HR is a pre-terminal hypoxic sign.

Action:

Airway/Breathing: Immediate ventilatory support (BVM) to treat hypoxia/acidosis (the cause of bradycardia).

Circulation: Initiate CPR (HR < 60 in infant/child who is unresponsive), rapid IO access, Epinephrine (10 mcg/kg).

Pattern: A $\downarrow$, C $\downarrow$. This child is coding.

</details>

Case 2: The Screaming Kid

PAT Findings:

Appearance: Extremely irritable, screaming, fighting the mask.

WOB: Severe intercostal retractions, loud wheezing. RR 45.

Circulation: Pink, warm, cap refill 1.5 seconds.

Diagnosis and Action:

<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

Diagnosis: Severe Respiratory Distress (Compensated). The screaming and high tone confirm brain perfusion is intact (for now).

Action:

Airway/Breathing: Keep the child calm (Ketamine if protocol allows, avoid sedatives that worsen WOB). High-flow O2/Nebulizers.

Escalation: Monitor closely for fatigue (a drop in RR, a quiet or limp appearance) – this signals failure.

Pattern: A Normal, WOB $\uparrow$. Treat aggressively to reduce WOB and prevent fatigue.

</details>

Case 3: The Clammy Kid

PAT Findings:

Appearance: Pale, weak cry, anxious, irritable.

WOB: Normal RR (26), no retractions, quiet.

Circulation: Mottled, clammy, cap refill > 3 seconds.

Vitals: HR 155, BP 98/60.

Diagnosis and Action:

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

Diagnosis: Compensated Shock (Likely hypovolemic or early septic).

Why: High HR, normal BP, but poor skin perfusion/delayed cap refill. The child is maintaining MAP but at the expense of end-organ perfusion.

Action:

Circulation: Aggressive IV/IO access. Fluid bolus (20 mL/kg NS/LR).

Monitor: Check response to fluid (HR/Cap Refill/Mental Status). Repeat bolus if needed.

Pattern: A $\downarrow$, C $\downarrow$. Treat aggressively before BP drops (decompensated shock).

Reflection

The PAT requires practice and discipline. You must get the three sides before you introduce confounding factors (like a BP cuff or a stressful intervention).

Here’s what you should know cold:

✅ PAT is the 30-second key to identifying pediatric collapse.
✅ Appearance is the most valuable side (Brain/Perfusion).
✅ Bradycardia is almost always a hypoxic sign in peds—ventilate first.
✅ If the child is pale/mottled, they are already compensating for shock.

Your Assignment:
Practice spotting the three sides of the PAT on every child you see, even if they're healthy. Make it automatic. Because when you encounter a sick child, you won't have time to think—you must recognize the pattern instantly.
