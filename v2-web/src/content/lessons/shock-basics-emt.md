## Warm-up Scenario

You walk into a back bedroom.  
The patient is pale, cool, and sweaty. The family says, “He was fine an hour ago.”

Before you touch anything, ask yourself:

- What could be wrong?
- What do you want to know first?
- What will kill him in the next 5–10 minutes?

## Quick Check-In

Answer a few questions to see where your brain goes first.

## What Is Shock?

Plain version:

> Shock is when delivery of oxygen and nutrients cannot keep up with what the tissues need.

Key pieces for EMT level:

- **Pump problem**: the heart cannot move blood (cardiogenic).
- **Pipe problem**: the vessels are too dilated or leaky (distributive).
- **Fluid problem**: not enough volume in the system (hypovolemic / hemorrhagic).

You are not expected to give a textbook definition on scene.  
You are expected to see the pattern fast.

Look for:

- Restless or anxious mental status
- Pale, cool, clammy skin
- Faster pulse, often weak
- Faster breathing
- Delayed cap refill or weak radial pulses

## Compensated vs Decompensated Shock

**Compensated**

- Body is still fighting to keep BP normal.
- Tachycardia, tachypnea, cool skin.
- BP may still look “okay” on the monitor.

**Decompensated**

- Body can’t keep up anymore.
- BP drops.
- Mental status worsens.
- Radial pulses vanish, central pulses weak.

If you wait for hypotension to “prove” shock, you waited too long.

## EMT Priorities

1. **Stop the bleed** (if external).  
2. **High-flow oxygen** if indicated by local protocol.  
3. **Supine or shock position** unless contraindicated.  
4. **Rapid transport** to appropriate facility.  
5. **Early radio report** describing suspected shock, mental status, vitals, and obvious cause.

Document what you saw changing over time, not just single numbers.

## Practice Cases

### Case 1

- 24-year-old, single GSW to thigh  
- Awake but anxious  
- HR 132, RR 26, BP 118/78  
- Cool, pale, sweating

**Question:**  
Is this patient in shock? What are your first two actions?

### Case 2

- 70-year-old, sepsis from pneumonia  
- Confused, hot skin, BP 86/50, HR 118, RR 30

**Question:**  
Which type of shock is most likely, and what is your on-scene priority?

## Next Steps

- Review **Bleeding and Hemorrhage Control** (future lesson link).
- Try building your own case in your notebook: MOI, vitals, skin, and what you would do.
