## Arrival Scenario

You arrive at a parking lot.  
Male in his 20s, lying on the ground, yelling. Dark red blood is pooling near his leg.  

Before you do anything else, ask yourself:

- Is this **life-threatening bleeding**?
- What can I do in the next **30 seconds** that actually matters?
- What tools do I have on me right now?

## Types of Bleeding (What You See)

**Arterial**

- Bright red  
- Spurting or pulsatile  
- Can empty a patient in minutes  

**Venous**

- Dark red  
- Steady flow  
- Can still be massive, especially from proximal veins  

**Capillary**

- Oozing  
- Usually from abrasions  
- Annoying, not usually life-threatening on its own  

The label is less important than the **rate** and **volume** of loss.

## External vs Internal Hemorrhage

**External**

- You can see it  
- You can usually reach it  
- You can often fix it with **pressure, packing, or tourniquet**

**Internal**

- You mostly **infer** it from:
  - MOI (falls, MVCs, blunt trauma, penetrating torso)
  - Bruising, distension, pain
  - Shock signs (tachycardia, cool clammy skin, AMS)
- You cannot stop it prehospital, but you can:
  - Support perfusion
  - Move fast to the right facility
  - Give a clear report

## Hemorrhage Control Algorithm (EMT level)

Think: **“PRESSURE → PACK → WRAP → TOURNIQUET”**

1. **Expose the wound**
   - Cut away clothing
   - Look for multiple wounds

2. **Direct Pressure**
   - Gloved hand / trauma pad on the source of bleeding
   - Use both hands if needed
   - Do not keep lifting to “check” every 3 seconds

3. **Wound Packing** (if trained / allowed)
   - For deep junctional wounds (groin, axilla, neck)  
   - Pack hemostatic or plain gauze **directly onto the bleed**
   - Keep stuffing until the cavity is full, then hold firm pressure 3+ minutes

4. **Pressure Dressing**
   - Wrap to hold your packing or gauze in place
   - Still check for continued bleeding

5. **Tourniquet**
   - For life-threatening extremity bleeding that is not controlled with direct pressure
   - Place **high and tight** on the limb, proximal to the wound
   - Tighten until bleeding stops and distal pulse is gone
   - Note the time

6. **Reassess constantly**
   - Is the dressing soaked through?
   - Is the tourniquet still effective?
   - Are they slipping into shock?

## Practice Table: What Would You Do?

| Situation                                           | Best First Move                          |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Bright red spurting bleed from mid-forearm         | Direct pressure → tourniquet if needed  |
| Oozing abrasion on shin after fall from bike       | Clean + simple dressing                  |
| Deep groin wound from rebar, heavy dark bleeding   | Pack wound + direct pressure             |
| Amputated hand, bleeding heavily                   | Direct pressure → tourniquet             |

## When Is Bleeding “Life-Threatening”?

Use this mental shortcut:

> **“I can’t control it quickly, and it’s obviously changing the floor.”**

Red flags:

- Blood soaking multiple dressings quickly  
- Pooling on ground / running off stretcher  
- Associated with:
  - Tachycardia  
  - Cool, pale skin  
  - Altered mental status  

If you are thinking about “how many 4x4s” you need, you are probably already behind.

## Shock Tie-In

Severe hemorrhage → **hypovolemic shock**.

Look for:

- Increasing heart rate  
- Narrowing pulse pressure  
- Weak or absent radial pulses  
- Tachypnea  
- Anxiety → confusion → unresponsiveness  

Management at EMT level:

- Control the bleeding (first, always)  
- High-flow oxygen per protocol  
- Keep patient warm  
- Rapid transport & early notification

## Mini Cases

### Case 1 – Industrial Accident

- 35-year-old with partial arm amputation at mid-humerus  
- Bright red, spurting bleeding  
- Patient is awake but panicked, HR 140, RR 28, skin cool and pale  

**Your moves in order:**

1. Expose and apply firm direct pressure  
2. Apply tourniquet high and tight on upper arm  
3. Confirm bleeding stopped and no distal pulse  
4. Cover stump, control pain as able, treat for shock, rapid transport  

---

### Case 2 – Groin Laceration

- 19-year-old stabbed in the groin  
- Dark blood, heavy flow, difficult to compress with flat dressing  

**Your moves in order:**

1. Expose fully, identify exact bleed location  
2. Pack wound firmly with hemostatic or plain gauze  
3. Maintain pressure 3+ minutes  
4. Apply pressure dressing, reassess for continued bleeding

## Take-Home Points

- Bleeding control is about **committing** to pressure, not sprinkling gauze.  
- Tourniquets are safe and lifesaving when used correctly.  
- If bleeding is not controlled and the patient looks shocky, your number one job is **stop the leak + move fast**.
