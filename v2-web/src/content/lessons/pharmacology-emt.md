## Street-level Pharmacology

EMTs don’t need med-school knowledge.  
You need **pattern recognition.**  
If a patient looks like *this*, this drug does *that*.

Break it down into four buckets:

### 1. Airway/Breathing
- **Albuterol**  
  Opens bronchioles in asthma and COPD.  
  If the wheeze is gone because **air movement is gone**, it won’t help.

### 2. Circulation
- **Nitroglycerin**  
  Drops preload. Use only when:
  - BP is stable  
  - No ED meds  
  - No suspicion of right-sided MI

### 3. Sugar
- **Oral Glucose**  
  Use only when they can swallow.  
  If they’re slurring or altered, don’t risk aspiration.

### 4. Pain
- **Aspirin** (for clotting, not pain)  
  Chew it. If they already self-administered, do not double-dose.

## Scenario: Chest Pain at a Grocery Store

You arrive to find a 58-year-old male.  
He looks anxious. Chest pain radiates to the jaw.

Ask yourself:

1. Does this sound like cardiac ischemia?
2. Can I give Aspirin?
3. Can I assist with prescribed Nitroglycerin?
