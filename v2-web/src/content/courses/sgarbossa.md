# Sgarbossa Criteria

**Level:** Advanced
**Topic:** ECG Interpretation, STEMI, Critical Care
**Duration:** Deep Dive

***

## Arrival Scenario

You’re handed a 70M “chest pain, LBBB,” ECG for review. ST changes? Or is it all baseline? The charge nurse says, “He doesn’t look right.”
You pull up the Sgarbossa flowchart: can you rule out or in STEMI in a wide-complex EKG—within 3 minutes?

***

## Warm-Up Questions

1. What’s the clinical significance of discordant ST elevation in LBBB?
2. How do you use the modified Sgarbossa criteria in left bundle or paced rhythms?
3. Which lead patterns and numbers are truly “Sgarbossa-positive”?
4. Why is overcalling STEMI in LBBB dangerous?
5. How do you integrate Sgarbossa findings with clinical status?

## Explanation / Breakdown

### Sgarbossa Criteria (Classic)

- **Concordant ST elevation ≥1 mm in any lead with a positive QRS** (5 points)
- **Concordant ST depression ≥1 mm in V1–V3** (3 points)
- **Discordant ST elevation ≥5 mm in leads with negative QRS** (2 points)


### Modified (Smith/“Excessive Discordance”):

- Discordant ST elevation ≥1 mm and **ST/S ratio ≥0.25** (sensitive for MI)


### When to Apply:

- Only in LBBB or paced rhythms with symptoms concerning for ACS


### Score ≥3 = strongly suggestive of acute MI


***

## Common Mistakes

- Overcalling minor discordant ST elevation as positive (beware baseline LBBB repolarization).
- Forgetting to check for “concordance”—the highest specificity criterion.
- Applying Sgarbossa outside appropriate context.
- Failing to integrate other ECG/clinical findings (Q waves, T wave inversions).

***

## Clinical Pearls

- “Concordant” = ST aligns with the majority of the QRS.
- In classic LBBB, small discordant changes are expected; “excessive” discordance is key for pathology.
- Modified Sgarbossa (ST/S ratio) increases MI sensitivity.
- Always pair ECG interpretation with patient—“worried look” trumps numbers.

## Decision Trees

**Sgarbossa Quick Algorithm**

1. **Symptoms + LBBB/Paced?**
2. **Concordant ST ↑ ≥1mm any lead?**
    - Yes: STEMI likely
3. **Concordant ST ↓ ≥1mm in V1–V3?**
    - Yes: STEMI likely
4. **Discordant ST ↑ ≥5mm or modified ratio ≥0.25?**
    - Yes: STEMI likely
5. **If none, but high suspicion:**
    - Escalate, consult, repeat ECGs

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: Classic Concordance

- 67M, chest pain, LBBB, ST ↑ 2mm in V3 concordant
> STEMI by Sgarbossa?


### Case 2: Modified Ratio

- 82F, new SOB, LBBB, QRS mostly neg, ST ↑ 2mm, S wave 6mm
> ST/S = 0.33. Next step?

## Reflection 

- What component of Sgarbossa do you need to practice most?
- How would you teach the difference between normal LBBB changes and Sgarbossa positives?
- What is your backup if “criteria negative” but the patient looks sick?
