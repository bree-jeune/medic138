# ECG Basics

**Level:** Beginner to Intermediate  
**Topic:** Cardiology / ECG Interpretation  
**Duration:** 75 minutes

---

## Arrival Scenario

You're dispatched to a 62-year-old male with "chest discomfort." He's sitting on the couch, pale, diaphoretic, rubbing his chest.

Your partner starts the assessment. You grab the monitor and place the 4-lead. The rhythm appears on the screen.

"What do you see?" your partner asks.

**This is where it starts. Everything else builds from here.**

## Warm-Up Questions

Before we break down the ECG, answer these:

1. **What does the P wave represent?**
2. **What's the normal PR interval range?**
3. **How long is one small box on ECG paper at 25 mm/sec?**
4. **What's the normal QRS duration?**
5. **What leads look at the inferior wall of the heart?**

These are foundation questions. Know them cold.

## Explanation / Breakdown

### ECG Paper Basics

**Standard paper speed:** 25 mm/sec

**Horizontal axis = TIME**
- **Small box:** 0.04 seconds (40 milliseconds)
- **Large box:** 0.20 seconds (200 milliseconds)
- **5 large boxes:** 1 second
- **300 large boxes:** 1 minute

**Vertical axis = VOLTAGE**
- **Small box:** 0.1 mV (1 mm)
- **Large box:** 0.5 mV (5 mm)

### The Cardiac Cycle on ECG

**P Wave**
- **Represents:** Atrial depolarization
- **Duration:** < 0.12 seconds (< 3 small boxes)
- **Amplitude:** < 2.5 mm in limb leads
- **Tells you:** SA node fired, atria are contracting

**PR Interval**
- **Represents:** Time from atrial depolarization to ventricular depolarization
- **Measured:** Start of P wave to start of QRS
- **Normal:** 0.12 - 0.20 seconds (3-5 small boxes)
- **Tells you:** AV node conduction time

**QRS Complex**
- **Represents:** Ventricular depolarization
- **Duration:** < 0.12 seconds (< 3 small boxes)
- **Q wave:** First downward deflection
- **R wave:** First upward deflection
- **S wave:** Downward deflection after R wave
- **Tells you:** Ventricles are contracting

**ST Segment**
- **Represents:** Early ventricular repolarization
- **Measured:** End of QRS to start of T wave
- **Should be:** Isoelectric (flat, at baseline)
- **Tells you:** If elevated or depressed → ischemia/infarction

**T Wave**
- **Represents:** Ventricular repolarization
- **Shape:** Rounded, asymmetric
- **Direction:** Usually same as QRS
- **Tells you:** If inverted/peaked → ischemia, electrolyte abnormality

**QT Interval**
- **Represents:** Total time for ventricular depolarization + repolarization
- **Measured:** Start of QRS to end of T wave
- **Normal:** < 440 ms (males), < 460 ms (females)
- **Corrected for heart rate:** QTc (use Bazett formula)
- **Tells you:** If prolonged → risk of torsades de pointes

### The 12-Lead System

**Limb Leads (Frontal Plane)**

| Lead | View | Positive Electrode |
|------|------|-------------------|
| I | Lateral | Left arm |
| II | Inferior | Left leg |
| III | Inferior | Left leg |
| aVR | Right atrium | Right arm |
| aVL | Lateral | Left arm |
| aVF | Inferior | Left leg |

**Precordial Leads (Horizontal Plane)**

| Lead | Position | View |
|------|----------|------|
| V1 | 4th ICS, R sternal border | Septum |
| V2 | 4th ICS, L sternal border | Septum |
| V3 | Between V2 and V4 | Anterior |
| V4 | 5th ICS, midclavicular line | Anterior |
| V5 | 5th ICS, anterior axillary line | Lateral |
| V6 | 5th ICS, midaxillary line | Lateral |

**Coronary Artery Territories**

| Leads | Wall | Artery |
|-------|------|--------|
| II, III, aVF | Inferior | RCA (usually) |
| V1-V4 | Anterior/Septal | LAD |
| I, aVL, V5-V6 | Lateral | LCX (or LAD) |
| V1-V2 (tall R) | Posterior | RCA or LCX |

### Systematic ECG Interpretation

Use this every single time:

**1. Rate**
- **Method 1 (Regular rhythm):** 300 / (# large boxes between R waves)
- **Method 2 (Irregular rhythm):** Count R waves in 6 seconds x 10
- **Method 3 (Very fast):** 1500 / (# small boxes between R waves)

**2. Rhythm**
- Regular or irregular?
- Are P waves present?
- Is there a P before every QRS?
- Is there a QRS after every P?

**3. Axis**
- Use Lead I and aVF (see Axis Deviation course)

**4. Intervals**
- **PR interval:** Normal (0.12-0.20), short, or prolonged?
- **QRS duration:** Narrow (< 0.12) or wide (≥ 0.12)?
- **QT interval:** Normal or prolonged?

**5. Morphology**
- Hypertrophy (high voltage)?
- Bundle branch blocks (wide QRS with specific patterns)?
- Q waves (old MI)?

**6. ST Segments & T Waves**
- ST elevation (STEMI)?
- ST depression (ischemia)?
- T wave inversions (ischemia, old MI)?
- Hyperacute T waves (early STEMI)?

### Common Rhythms

**Normal Sinus Rhythm**
- Rate: 60-100 bpm
- Regular rhythm
- P before every QRS
- QRS after every P
- PR interval normal

**Sinus Bradycardia**
- Rate: < 60 bpm
- Otherwise normal sinus rhythm
- Causes: Athletes, meds (beta blockers), vagal tone, hypothermia, increased ICP

**Sinus Tachycardia**
- Rate: > 100 bpm
- Otherwise normal sinus rhythm
- Causes: Pain, fever, anxiety, hypovolemia, shock, PE, drugs

**Atrial Fibrillation**
- No P waves
- Irregularly irregular rhythm
- Narrow QRS (usually)
- Undulating baseline (fibrillatory waves)

**Atrial Flutter**
- "Sawtooth" flutter waves (best in II, III, aVF)
- Regular or irregular rhythm
- Atrial rate ~300 bpm
- Ventricular rate depends on AV conduction (2:1, 3:1, 4:1 block)

**SVT (Supraventricular Tachycardia)**
- Rate: 150-250 bpm
- Regular rhythm
- Narrow QRS
- P waves often hidden in QRS or T wave

**Ventricular Tachycardia**
- Rate: > 100 bpm (usually 120-250)
- Regular rhythm (usually)
- Wide QRS (≥ 0.12 seconds)
- No clear P waves

**Ventricular Fibrillation**
- Chaotic, disorganized electrical activity
- No identifiable waves
- Fatal without immediate defibrillation

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Not Using a Systematic Approach
Skipping steps leads to missed findings. Use the same approach every time.

### Mistake #2: Calling Everything "Normal Sinus Rhythm"
Look closer. There's always something to find or rule out.

### Mistake #3: Ignoring the Clinical Picture
ECG interpretation without context is worthless. Know your patient.

### Mistake #4: Misplacing Leads
V1-V6 in the wrong spots changes the entire interpretation. Know your landmarks.

### Mistake #5: Missing Subtle ST Changes
Not all STEMIs are dramatic. Look for 1 mm elevation in 2 contiguous leads.

### Mistake #6: Assuming Wide Complex = VT
Could also be SVT with aberrancy, bundle branch block, or WPW. Context matters.

## Clinical Pearls

💎 **Rate x rhythm x axis x intervals x morphology x ST/T = complete interpretation.**

💎 **If you can't explain a finding, it's worth mentioning.** Don't ignore things you don't understand.

💎 **Reciprocal changes confirm STEMI.** ST depression in opposite leads = real infarction.

💎 **Bundle branch blocks make STEMI diagnosis difficult.** Use Sgarbossa criteria for LBBB.

💎 **New vs. old matters.** Compare to old ECGs when possible.

💎 **One abnormal ECG doesn't make a diagnosis.** Clinical context + serial ECGs + troponin.

💎 **The most dangerous rhythms don't always look dramatic.** Subtle ST elevation kills.

💎 **Artifact looks like VF.** Check the patient before you shock them.

💎 **Right-sided leads (V3R, V4R) catch right ventricular MIs.** Use them in inferior STEMIs.

💎 **Posterior MI hides on standard 12-lead.** Look for tall R waves in V1-V2, get posterior leads (V7-V9).

## Decision Trees

### Rhythm Interpretation Flowchart

```
START: Is there a pulse?
    NO → VF or Pulseless VT or Asystole or PEA
        → Begin CPR, follow ACLS
    YES → Continue
    ↓
Is the rhythm regular or irregular?
    ↓
REGULAR
    ↓
    Are there P waves?
        YES → P before every QRS?
            YES → Normal sinus rhythm, sinus brady, or sinus tachy
            NO → AV block (2nd or 3rd degree)
        NO → Atrial fibrillation (wait, afib is irregular)
             Ventricular tachycardia
             SVT with hidden P waves
    ↓
    Is QRS narrow (< 0.12 sec)?
        YES → Supraventricular rhythm (SVT, sinus, atrial flutter)
        NO → Ventricular rhythm (VT, paced, bundle branch block)

IRREGULAR
    ↓
    Are there P waves?
        YES → Variable PR intervals?
            YES → 2nd degree AV block (Mobitz I or II)
            NO → Multifocal atrial tachycardia, frequent PACs
        NO → Atrial fibrillation
             Atrial flutter with variable block
    ↓
    Is QRS narrow or wide?
        NARROW → Atrial fibrillation most likely
        WIDE → Afib with bundle branch block, VT (rare to be irregular)
```

### STEMI Identification

```
ECG Shows ST Elevation
    ↓
Is it ≥1 mm in 2 contiguous leads?
    NO → Not STEMI criteria (but monitor closely)
    YES → Continue
    ↓
Which leads are affected?
    ↓
    II, III, aVF → INFERIOR STEMI
        Check for:
        - Reciprocal ST depression in I, aVL
        - Right ventricular involvement (V3R, V4R)
        - Posterior involvement (V7-V9)
        RCA occlusion likely
    ↓
    V1-V4 → ANTERIOR STEMI
        LAD occlusion
        High risk for cardiogenic shock, LV dysfunction
    ↓
    V5-V6, I, aVL → LATERAL STEMI
        LCX occlusion
    ↓
    Tall R in V1-V2 + ST depression V1-V3 → POSTERIOR STEMI
        Get posterior leads (V7-V9)
        RCA or LCX occlusion
    ↓
Activate cath lab
Aspirin, nitro (if BP allows)
12-lead serial ECGs
Rapid transport
```

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: The Subtle STEMI

**Patient:** 58-year-old male, "indigestion" x 30 minutes  
**Vitals:** BP 138/82, HR 88, RR 18  
**ECG:** Regular rhythm, rate 88, ST elevation 1.5 mm in leads III and aVF, ST depression 1 mm in leads I and aVL

**What's the diagnosis?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Inferior STEMI

**Why:**
- ST elevation ≥1 mm in 2 contiguous leads (III, aVF = inferior)
- Reciprocal ST depression in I, aVL (confirms real STEMI, not artifact)
- Likely RCA occlusion

**Action:**
- Activate cath lab
- Aspirin 324 mg PO
- Nitro 0.4 mg SL (if BP allows)
- IV access
- Get right-sided ECG (V3R, V4R) - rule out RV involvement
- Serial 12-leads
- Rapid transport

**Clinical Pearl:** Reciprocal changes = real STEMI. This isn't artifact or early repolarization.

### Case 2: The Fast Heart

**Patient:** 34-year-old female, palpitations x 20 minutes, lightheaded  
**Vitals:** BP 102/64, HR 180, RR 22  
**ECG:** Regular rhythm, rate 180, narrow QRS, no visible P waves

**What rhythm is this?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** SVT (Supraventricular Tachycardia)

**Why:**
- Rate 150-250 (classic SVT range)
- Regular rhythm
- Narrow QRS (supraventricular origin)
- No visible P waves (hidden in QRS or T wave)

**Action:**
- Vagal maneuvers first (if stable)
  - Valsalva (bear down)
  - Carotid massage (if no bruits, < 65 years old)
- If no conversion:
  - Adenosine 6 mg rapid IV push (followed by 20 mL NS flush)
  - If no conversion: 12 mg
  - If no conversion: 12 mg again
- If unstable (chest pain, hypotension, altered mental status):
  - Synchronized cardioversion (50-100 J)

**Clinical Pearl:** Adenosine works in >90% of SVT cases. It's diagnostic and therapeutic.

</details>

### Case 3: The Irregular Rhythm

**Patient:** 76-year-old male, weakness, no chest pain  
**Vitals:** BP 118/74, HR "130-160", RR 18  
**ECG:** Irregularly irregular rhythm, no clear P waves, narrow QRS, undulating baseline

**What is this?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response

**Why:**
- Irregularly irregular (hallmark of afib)
- No P waves
- Undulating baseline (fibrillatory waves)
- Narrow QRS (conducted through AV node normally)
- Rate > 100 = RVR

**Action:**
- Check for hemodynamic instability
  - If stable: Rate control (diltiazem, metoprolol)
  - If unstable: Synchronized cardioversion (120-200 J)
- Assess stroke risk (anticoagulation needed if chronic)
- Look for reversible causes: sepsis, PE, hyperthyroidism, alcohol

**Clinical Pearl:** Afib with RVR in a sick patient often means something else is wrong (sepsis, PE, MI). Treat the cause.

</details>

### Case 4: The Wide Complex

**Patient:** 68-year-old male, chest pain, diaphoretic, altered  
**Vitals:** BP 82/50, HR 190, RR 26  
**ECG:** Regular rhythm, rate 190, wide QRS (0.16 sec), no clear P waves

**What's your move?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Ventricular Tachycardia (unstable) → immediate cardioversion

**Why:**
- Wide QRS (≥0.12 sec)
- Rate > 100
- Regular rhythm
- Hemodynamically unstable (hypotensive, altered)

**Action:**
- **Immediate synchronized cardioversion** (don't delay)
  - 100 J biphasic (or 200 J monophasic)
  - Sedate if conscious (etomidate, versed, ketamine)
- IV access
- Amiodarone 150 mg over 10 min after conversion (if needed)
- Transport to PCI-capable center
- Continuous monitoring

**Clinical Pearl:** Wide complex tachycardia in an unstable patient = VT until proven otherwise. Don't waste time trying to differentiate. Cardiovert.

</details>

---

### Case 5: The Slow Heart

**Patient:** 82-year-old female, syncope, fell  
**Vitals:** BP 88/52, HR 38, RR 16  
**ECG:** Regular rhythm, rate 38, P waves present but no relationship to QRS, narrow QRS

**What's the rhythm?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Third-Degree (Complete) AV Block

**Why:**
- Bradycardia
- P waves present
- **No relationship between P waves and QRS** (AV dissociation)
- Narrow QRS suggests junctional escape rhythm

**Action:**
- **Transcutaneous pacing** (patient is symptomatic)
  - Start at 60-70 bpm
  - Increase mA until capture
  - Sedate if conscious (painful)
- Atropine 0.5 mg IV (may not work in complete block, but try)
- Dopamine or epinephrine infusion if no pacer available
- IV fluids
- Transport for transvenous pacemaker

**Clinical Pearl:** Complete heart block = pacemaker needed (temporary or permanent). Medical management is a bridge, not definitive.

## Reflection

You just learned the foundation of ECG interpretation.

Here's what you should walk away with:

✅ ECG paper basics (time, voltage, boxes)  
✅ Cardiac cycle components (P, QRS, ST, T)  
✅ Systematic interpretation approach (rate, rhythm, axis, intervals, morphology, ST/T)  
✅ Common rhythms (NSR, brady, tachy, afib, SVT, VT, VF)  
✅ STEMI identification basics  
✅ Lead placement and coronary territories  

**Next-level thinking:**
- How do bundle branch blocks change interpretation?
- What's the difference between STEMI and STEMI mimics?
- How do you use Sgarbossa criteria?
- What are the causes of ST elevation besides MI?

**Your assignment:**  
Run a 12-lead on every chest pain patient. Practice your systematic approach. Compare your interpretation to the medic you're working with. Read the reports from the hospital. Build the pattern recognition.

ECGs are a language. The more you speak it, the more fluent you become.
