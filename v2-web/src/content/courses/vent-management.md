# Ventilator Management

**Level:** Advanced
**Topic:** Ventilator, Airway, EMS/Critical Care
**Duration:** Deep Dive

***

## Arrival Scenario

“Patient on transport vent, O₂ dropping, high pressure alarm.”
You must troubleshoot: is this patient, tube, bronchospasm, equipment, cuff leak, or something else?
Proper setup and real-time troubleshooting = life and death on scene or in air.

***

## Warm-Up Questions

1. What is the best “emergency ventilator change” for falling SpO₂?
2. Which vent settings most impact oxygenation vs ventilation?
3. What’s the “DOPES” approach and why does it save lives?
4. When is manual bagging safer than messing with vent?
5. How do you spot a tube or circuit problem in seconds?

## Explanation / Breakdown

- **Modes:** AC, SIMV, CPAP, BiPAP—understand each use case.
- **Key Settings:**
    - O₂/FiO₂: Oxygenation
    - PEEP: Keeps alveoli open
    - RR \& Tidal Volume: Main ventilatory control
- **Troubleshooting:** DOPES
    - **Displacement** (check tube)
    - **Obstruction** (suction tube/bronch)
    - **Pneumothorax** (physical exam, US if on hand)
    - **Equipment Failure** (swap circuits, check vent power/flow)
    - **Stacked breaths** (air-trapping, auto-PEEP)
- **Waveform Monitoring:** Plateau vs peak pressure, cuff leaks, secretions

***

## Common Mistakes

- Changing multiple settings at once—alters diagnosis/progression.
- Ignoring rise in peak pressure as early airway problem.
- Missing humidification or field secretions in long hauls.
- Over-bagging or disconnecting unnecessarily.

***

## Clinical Pearls

- O₂ down + high pressure alarm = suction, check tube, then bag manual if doubt.
- Never raise tidal volume before optimizing oxygenation/vent.
- Management: Permissive hypoxia/hypercapnia sometimes better than barotrauma.
- Document vent settings, alarms, and changes at every handoff.

***

## Decision Trees

**Troubleshooting DOPES**

1. O₂ dropping, alarm sounds.
2. Displacement: Tube in? Equal breath sounds?
3. Obstruction: Can you pass suction?
4. Pneumo: One-sided chest rise, decreased sounds?
5. Equipment: Cuff up, tube intact, vent circuit clear?
6. Stacked breaths: Rapid RR, incomplete exhalation, “fish tail” on waveform.

***

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: Secretions block tube, new alarm

### Case 2: Sudden air leak, circuit loose or cuff down

### Case 3: Pneumothorax develops in flight, high pressure alert

### Case 4: Equipment power loss

## Reflection

- Which vent alarm still causes “field panic” for you?
- What’s your most efficient DOPES troubleshooting sequence?
- What do you communicate during every vent transfer, regardless of patient status?
