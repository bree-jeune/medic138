## ABG Interpretation Overview

**Level:** Advanced  
**Topic:** Critical Care / Respiratory  
**Duration:** 60 minutes

---

## Arrival Scenario

You're transporting a 68-year-old COPD patient from a community hospital to a tertiary care center. The patient is on BiPAP at 12/5, FiO2 50%, with decreased level of consciousness. The sending facility hands you this ABG drawn 30 minutes ago:

- **pH:** 7.28  
- **PaCO2:** 68 mmHg  
- **PaO2:** 58 mmHg  
- **HCO3:** 31 mEq/L  
- **BE:** +4

The nurse says "it's compensated respiratory acidosis" and sends you on your way.

**Your first thought should be:** Is this actually compensated? What's the primary problem? And what does this mean for my transport plan?

---

## Warm-Up Questions

Before we break down the framework, answer these:

1. **What's the difference between compensation and correction?**
2. **If the pH is abnormal, can the ABG be fully compensated?**
3. **What's the normal range for PaCO2? HCO3? pH?**
4. **How long does it take kidneys to compensate for a respiratory problem?**
5. **What's more dangerous: pH 7.25 or PaCO2 of 65?**

Take a moment. Think it through. These aren't trick questions—they're the foundation of ABG interpretation.

## Explanation / Breakdown

### The Framework: ROME + Compensation Check

ABG interpretation isn't magic. It's pattern recognition. Here's the method:

#### Step 1: Look at the pH
- **pH < 7.35** → Acidosis (problem)
- **pH > 7.45** → Alkalosis (problem)
- **pH 7.35–7.45** → Normal (or fully compensated)

#### Step 2: Determine the Primary Problem (ROME Method)

**Respiratory Opposite, Metabolic Equal**

- If **pH and CO2 move in opposite directions** → **Respiratory problem**
  - pH ↓ and CO2 ↑ = Respiratory Acidosis
  - pH ↑ and CO2 ↓ = Respiratory Alkalosis

- If **pH and HCO3 move in the same direction** → **Metabolic problem**
  - pH ↓ and HCO3 ↓ = Metabolic Acidosis
  - pH ↑ and HCO3 ↑ = Metabolic Alkalosis

#### Step 3: Check for Compensation

The body doesn't just sit there. It tries to fix the problem:

- **Respiratory problems** → kidneys compensate (takes 24-48 hours)
- **Metabolic problems** → lungs compensate (takes minutes to hours)

**Compensation Rules:**
- **Partial compensation:** pH abnormal, but other value moving to help
- **Full compensation:** pH normal (7.35–7.45), both CO2 and HCO3 abnormal
- **No compensation:** Only one value abnormal

#### Step 4: Evaluate Oxygenation

- **PaO2 < 60 mmHg** → Hypoxemia (problem)
- **PaO2 60-80 mmHg** → Acceptable on supplemental O2
- **PaO2 > 80 mmHg** → Normal

Also calculate the **A-a gradient** if needed (advanced).

### Normal Values (Memorize These)

| Parameter | Normal Range |
|-----------|--------------|
| pH | 7.35 – 7.45 |
| PaCO2 | 35 – 45 mmHg |
| PaO2 | 80 – 100 mmHg |
| HCO3 | 22 – 26 mEq/L |
| BE | -2 to +2 |

### Real-World Translation

**Respiratory Acidosis (pH ↓, CO2 ↑)**
- **Think:** Not breathing enough, retaining CO2
- **Causes:** COPD exacerbation, opioid overdose, neuromuscular weakness, airway obstruction
- **Fix:** Improve ventilation (BiPAP, intubation, reverse sedation)

**Respiratory Alkalosis (pH ↑, CO2 ↓)**
- **Think:** Breathing too much, blowing off CO2
- **Causes:** Anxiety, pain, hypoxia, pulmonary embolism, sepsis
- **Fix:** Treat underlying cause, adjust vent settings

**Metabolic Acidosis (pH ↓, HCO3 ↓)**
- **Think:** Too much acid or lost too much base
- **Causes:** DKA, sepsis, lactic acidosis, renal failure, diarrhea
- **Fix:** Treat cause (fluids, insulin, pressors), consider bicarb if severe

**Metabolic Alkalosis (pH ↑, HCO3 ↑)**
- **Think:** Lost acid or too much base
- **Causes:** Vomiting, diuretics, excessive bicarb
- **Fix:** Usually self-correcting, replace fluids/electrolytes

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Calling It "Compensated" When pH Is Abnormal
If the pH is outside 7.35–7.45, it's NOT fully compensated. It's **partially compensated** or **uncompensated**.

**Example:**  
pH 7.28, CO2 68, HCO3 31  
This is **partially compensated respiratory acidosis**—not "compensated."

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Oxygenation
You can have perfect acid-base balance and still be hypoxic. Always check PaO2.

### Mistake #3: Forgetting Mixed Disorders
Sometimes patients have BOTH respiratory and metabolic problems. Look for:
- CO2 and HCO3 both moving in the wrong direction
- pH more abnormal than expected

### Mistake #4: Using ABGs to Diagnose Everything
ABGs show physiology, not etiology. They tell you what's happening, not always why.

### Mistake #5: Over-Trusting "Normal" pH
A pH of 7.38 can still represent serious underlying problems if both CO2 and HCO3 are abnormal (full compensation).

## Clinical Pearls

💎 **pH drives everything.** If pH is wrong, the patient is unstable—even if they look okay right now.

💎 **CO2 is fast, kidneys are slow.** Respiratory compensation happens in minutes. Metabolic compensation takes days.

💎 **Chronic vs. Acute matters.** COPD patients live at CO2 60-65. That same number in an overdose is a disaster.

💎 **Don't chase numbers in chronic patients.** A COPD patient with pH 7.38, CO2 58, HCO3 32 is at their baseline. Don't hyperventilate them.

💎 **Lactate + low HCO3 = serious.** This is lactic acidosis until proven otherwise. Think sepsis, shock, bowel ischemia.

💎 **If pH is < 7.20, the patient is in trouble.** Period. Doesn't matter what the cause is.

💎 **Base Excess (BE) helps.** Negative BE = metabolic acidosis. Positive BE = metabolic alkalosis. Ignore it for respiratory problems.

💎 **Know your patient.** ABG interpretation without clinical context is worthless.

## Decision Trees

### ABG Interpretation Flowchart

```
START: Look at pH
    ↓
pH < 7.35? → ACIDOSIS
    ↓
    Check CO2 and HCO3
    ↓
    CO2 ↑ (>45)? → Respiratory Acidosis
        ↓
        HCO3 ↑ (>26)? → Partial compensation
        pH normal? → Full compensation
    ↓
    HCO3 ↓ (<22)? → Metabolic Acidosis
        ↓
        CO2 ↓ (<35)? → Partial compensation
        pH normal? → Full compensation

pH > 7.45? → ALKALOSIS
    ↓
    Check CO2 and HCO3
    ↓
    CO2 ↓ (<35)? → Respiratory Alkalosis
        ↓
        HCO3 ↓ (<22)? → Partial compensation
        pH normal? → Full compensation
    ↓
    HCO3 ↑ (>26)? → Metabolic Alkalosis
        ↓
        CO2 ↑ (>45)? → Partial compensation
        pH normal? → Full compensation

pH 7.35-7.45 with abnormal CO2/HCO3?
    → FULLY COMPENSATED (or normal)
```

### Clinical Action Decision Tree

```
ABG Result Interpreted
    ↓
Is pH < 7.20?
    YES → Immediate intervention required
        ↓
        Respiratory cause? → Ventilate (BiPAP/intubate)
        Metabolic cause? → Treat source + consider bicarb
    NO → Continue assessment
        ↓
        Is PaO2 < 60?
            YES → Increase FiO2, optimize ventilation
            NO → Monitor
        ↓
        Does pH match clinical picture?
            NO → Recheck ABG or consider mixed disorder
            YES → Continue current management
```
