Obstetrics Emergencies

Level: Advanced
Topic: OB · EMS/Critical Care
Duration: Deep Dive

Arrival Scenario

You’re called for a 28F, 35 weeks, severe abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding. She’s pale, tachycardic, hypotensive, and doubled over.

You know OB emergencies can spiral fast. The question: is this preterm labor, placental abruption, uterine rupture, or something even more dangerous for both patients?

Warm-Up Questions

What’s the first bedside sign of maternal shock?

Which OB emergencies require immediate transport, not delivery?

What must you always check for in active third trimester bleeding?

How can you identify (and avoid causing) uterine rupture or cord prolapse?

Why is left lateral positioning critical in OB trauma/code scenarios?

Explanation / Breakdown

OB Crisis Patterns: Bleeding, Pressure, and Delivery

Hemorrhage Patterns (Placental Abruption, Previa, Rupture)

Condition

Pain

Bleeding

Uterus

Fetal Heart Rate

Placental Abruption

Severe, constant

Variable (often dark)

Rigid, board-like, tender

Fetal distress, bradycardia, late decels

Placenta Previa

None (painless)

Bright red, profuse

Soft, non-tender

Usually normal, unless profound maternal shock

Uterine Rupture

Severe, sudden, tearing

Variable, shock disproportionate to blood loss

Loss of fetal station, easily palpable fetus, loss of contractions

Fetal distress or demise

Field Priority: Stabilize maternal circulation (IV access x2, fluid, blood products if ordered) and expedite transport to surgical capability.

Eclampsia/Pre-eclampsia

Eclampsia: Seizures (tonic-clonic) in a pregnant patient.

Pre-eclampsia: Hypertension (BP >140/90 or >160/110) + proteinuria or organ dysfunction (headache, visual changes, RUQ pain).

Goal: Seizure control. Magnesium Sulfate is the mainstay. Manage severe hypertension with Labetalol or Hydralazine.

Delivery and Cord Prolapse

Cord Prolapse: Cord presents before the baby's head. Leads to cord compression and rapid fetal hypoxia.

Management: Place mother in knee-chest position or Trendelenburg. Gloved hand must remain inside to push the presenting part off the cord. This cannot stop until C-section. - Preterm Labor: Contractions + cervical changes before 37 weeks. Transport to facility capable of NICU care.

Common Mistakes

Delaying Transport in Unstable Hemorrhage: Do not waste time attempting delivery or stabilization if the mother is crashing from bleeding. Get moving.

Ignoring Eclampsia Warning Signs: Treat persistent headache, visual changes, and severe hypertension aggressively to prevent seizure.

Failing to Treat Supine Hypotensive Syndrome: Positioning the mother flat on her back compresses the vena cava (at >20 weeks), dropping BP. Always use left lateral tilt or position the mother on her left side.

Checking Fetal Status Before Maternal Status: Maternal stability dictates fetal outcome. Treat Mom first.

Clinical Pearls

💎 Left Lateral Tilt: Required for all third-trimester patients, especially during trauma or hypotensive crisis, to relieve vena cava compression.

💎 Magnesium Watch: Monitor respiratory rate and deep tendon reflexes (DTRs). Loss of DTRs = hypermagnesemia. Administer Calcium Chloride (1g IV) as the antidote for respiratory depression/arrest.

💎 Painful vs. Painless Bleeding: Painful, rigid abdomen + bleeding = Abruption. Painless, profuse, bright red bleeding = Previa.

💎 Maternal Shock: Tachycardia and pale/cool skin are early warnings. Hypotension is a late, pre-arrest finding in pregnancy.

💎 Cord Prolapse: The gloved hand stays in until the baby is delivered by C-section. This is the exception to the "hands off" rule.

Decision Trees

OB Crisis Algorithm

3rd Trimester Patient in Distress
    ↓
1. Maternal ABCs: Left Lateral Tilt (L-Tilt)
    ↓
2. Severe Bleeding / Pain?
    YES (Painful + Rigid) → Suspect Abruption/Rupture
        → IV access x2, O2, Fluid/Blood Protocol
        → RAPID Transport to OR
    YES (Painless + Profuse) → Suspect Previa
        → IV access x2, O2, Fluid, avoid vaginal exam
        → RAPID Transport
    ↓
3. Seizure / Severe HTN (BP >160/110)?
    YES → Eclampsia Alert
        → Magnesium Sulfate (per protocol)
        → Labetalol/Hydralazine (if SBP >160 or DBP >110)
        → Prep airway (high aspiration risk)
    ↓
4. Cord Prolapse / Preterm Delivery Imminent?
    YES → Cord Prolapse Protocol (Hand in, Knee-Chest)
    NO → Transport to OB/NICU facility


Magnesium Sulfate Protocol (Eclampsia)

Eclampsia Seizure or Severe Pre-eclampsia
    ↓
1. Administer Loading Dose
    - Magnesium Sulfate 4–6g IV over 20–30 minutes
    - Monitor BP closely
    ↓
2. Monitor for Toxicity
    - Respirations <12/min? Loss of DTRs? Decreased LOC?
    ↓
    Toxicity Present?
        YES → STOP Mg drip, Give Calcium Chloride 1g IV
        NO → Continue Maintenance Drip (1–2g/hr)


Practice Cases

Case 1: Pain + Bleeding Third Trimester

Patient: 32F, 37 wks, bright red vaginal bleed, severe abdominal pain, no contractions.
Timeline: 0min—arrival, 8min—BP 82/44, HR 130, O₂ 98%

What’s your move to protect both patients?

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>
Answer: Placental Abruption (painful, dropping BP)

Action: Immediate Left Lateral Tilt, O₂, establish IV access x2, 1L fluid bolus, expedite transport. Do not delay transport for stabilization that requires blood bank/OR.

</details>

Case 2: Hypertensive Crisis

Patient: 25F, 30 wks, blurred vision, RUQ pain, BP 186/104.
Timeline: 0min—found seated, 12min—headache worsens, 15min—seizure

Which meds, what lines, and which complications to expect?

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>
Answer: Eclampsia (seizure confirms eclampsia).

Action: Airway protection, Benzodiazepines (if seizure continues >5 min), Mag Sulfate (4–6g IV push over 20 min). Expect potential respiratory depression from Mag/seizure. Prep Calcium Chloride as antidote.

</details>

Case 3: Cord Prolapse

Patient: 28F, 38 wks, sudden urge to push, cord visible at introitus.
Timeline: 0min—found on bathroom, 2min—bradycardia developing

What’s your manual and positioning priority?

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>
Answer: Cord Prolapse - Fetal Bradycardia is immediate hypoxia.

Action: Gloved hand in vagina, manually push the presenting fetal part off the cord. Mother into knee-chest or steep Trendelenburg position. Transport emergently; the hand stays in place until surgical delivery.

Reflection

You just learned to differentiate the deadly OB patterns.

Here’s what you should know:

✅ Left lateral tilt is non-negotiable for unstable pregnant patients.
✅ Painful bleeding (abruption) vs. painless bleeding (previa).
✅ Magnesium is the treatment for eclampsia seizures, Calcium is the antidote.
✅ Cord prolapse requires immediate manual elevation and positioning.

Your assignment:
Know your OB kit inside and out. Rehearse the Mag Sulfate antidote sequence and the Cord Prolapse protocol mentally. When these calls happen, they are 100% time-critical.
