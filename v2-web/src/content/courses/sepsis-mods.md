# Sepsis Mods

**Level:** Advanced
**Topic:** Sepsis, Organ Dysfunction, MODS, Critical Care
**Duration:** Deep Dive

***

## Arrival Scenario

Flight request: “68F, sepsis, now on third vasopressor, rising lactate, intubated. Needs transfer to ICU.” As you prepare, new orders for renal replacement and rising ventilator settings pop up.
You’re not just moving a septic patient—this is MODS (multi-organ dysfunction syndrome).
At what point do you escalate/life-support, what organ systems are your next focus, and how do you spot when it’s about to crash?

***

## Warm-Up Questions

1. What is the first organ commonly to fail (other than shock) in MODS?
2. Which lab or clinical marker tells you organ failure is outpacing your therapy?
3. What is your stepwise escalation for new respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis?
4. Which MODS patterns require early palliative or advanced planning conversations?
5. What sign/symptom pattern precedes “sepsis-induced DIC”?

## Explanation / Breakdown

### MODS in Sepsis

- **Definition:** Progressive organ dysfunction in a septic patient, not solely explained by a single cause.
- **Pathophys:** Endothelial injury, uncontrolled inflammation, mitochondrial failure; triggers: persistent infection, delayed Rx, preexisting organ disease.
- **Common Failing Organs:**
    - Respiratory: ARDS, hypoxemia
    - Renal: AKI, decreased urine, rising creatinine
    - Cardiac: Hypotension, arrhythmias, persistent shock
    - Coagulopathy: DIC, low platelets, bleeding
    - Hepatic: Jaundice, increased bili/INR
    - Neurologic: Delirium, coma


### Field Priorities

- Maximize O₂ delivery (optimize ventilation, address hypoxemia)
- Ongoing fluid assessment (beware overload; balance MAP >65 vs. lung/renal injury)
- Support each failing system: vasopressors for BP, vent for lungs, early RRT for kidneys, blood products for DIC/bleeding
- Frequent, trending reassessment

***

## Common Mistakes

- Focusing solely on one system (e.g., BP) and missing new organ failure.
- Delaying escalation to higher level support (e.g., RRT, vent, more advanced pressors).
- Ignoring subtle neurologic changes as “sedation” when actually encephalopathy.
- Fluid overload in “oliguric” patient—tipping into ARDS.

***

## Clinical Pearls

- **The sickest MODS patients can look deceptively stable until CRASH.**
- Tracking **urine output** and mental status is often the earliest sign of new/worsening dysfunction.
- If lactate and vasopressors both climbing without improvement—“Code MODS” for field activation/escalation.
- Handoff must include **timeline** of organ failures and therapies attempted.

***

## Decision Trees

**Protocol-Agnostic MODS Escalation**

1. **New organ dysfunction appears?**
    - Yes: Trend other organs; escalate/consult; anticipate crash
    - No: Continue current protocol, hourly reassessment
2. **O₂/vent/pulmonary issue?**
    - Yes: Increase vent/FiO₂, check for ARDS
    - No: Monitor U/O, map, CNS, perfusion
3. **Renal failure?**
    - Yes: Early RRT, reduce nephrotoxic drugs, watch fluid/lytes
4. **Uncontrolled coagulopathy?**
    - Yes: Blood products, factor replacement, minimize procedures

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: New Renal Failure

- Timeline: 0min—scene, 10min—anuria, 40min—K+ 6.9, rising BUN
- Question: Intervention sequence/priorities?


### Case 2: ARDS Crash

- Timeline: Lungs worsen, sat 82% on 90% FiO₂, PEEP maxed
- Question: How is this MODS, how do you escalate in-flight?


### Case 3: DIC Bleeding

- Timeline: All lines oozing, platelets 28, INR 3.2, labs trend down
- Question: Field red flags and supportive steps?

## Reflection 

** Reflection Questions:**

- How do you recognize shifting priorities as new organ failures emerge?
- What do you need from sending to receiving team for best MODS handoff?
- When do you move from “rescue” to “palliative” conversations?
