# SVT with Aberrancy

**Level:** Advanced
**Topic:** Cardiology, ECG, EMS/Critical Care
**Duration:** Deep Dive

***

## Arrival Scenario

You respond to an “unstable tachycardia.” The monitor: wide QRS tach (>160), no p waves, borderline hypotensive. “Is it VT or SVT with aberrancy?”
Your answer determines whether you shock, block, or both—what are your decision criteria?

***

## Warm-Up Questions

1. What ECG features favor VT over SVT with aberrancy?
2. Name two historical findings that argue for SVT.
3. Which medications are **never** given if you’re unsure?
4. Why is “capture/fusion” beat a can’t-miss clue?
5. When is adenosine both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool?

## Explanation / Breakdown

### Key ECG Clues

- **VT (Ventricular Tach):**
    - History: Old, h/o structural heart, infarct
    - Wide QRS (>140 ms), AV dissociation (independent p waves), fusion/capture beats, all positive/negative QRS in precordials, extreme axis
- **SVT with aberrancy:**
    - H/o young, no heart disease, sudden onset/offset, response to vagal/adenosine


### Treatment

- If unstable: SHOCK first
- If stable, likely SVT: Adenosine challenge (if wide IRREGULAR, never)
- NEVER give Ca-channel or adenosine if unsure/suspect pre-excite (afib+WPW) or wide-irregular

***

## Common Mistakes

- Delaying shock in true VT; most patients tolerate SVT better
- Administering AV nodal blocks to wide, irregular, or undifferentiated tachyarrhythmias
- Missing fusion/capture as the best proof of VT

***

## Clinical Pearls

- When in doubt, shock the unstable or undifferentiated wide tach
- Try adenosine ONLY if regular stable wide, not known to be VT, and not irregular
- VT is much more common than SVT with aberrancy in adults (>90%)
- Always reassess for recurrence, especially after vagal/adenosine

***

## Decision Trees

**Is it VT or SVT with Aberrancy?**

1. History structural heart dz? QRS >0.14s?
    - Yes → Likely VT
2. Response to vagal/adenosine?
    - Yes → SVT
3. Irregular wide?
    - Don’t treat as SVT; avoid nodal blockers

***

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: Elderly, Prior MI

- 68M, palpitations, wide QRS tach, fusion beats visible, unresponsive to vagal.
> What’s the rhythm? Treatment?


### Case 2: Youth, No Heart Hx

- 22F, sudden palpitations, 160s, reg wide QRS, converts with adenosine.
> SVT or VT?

## Reflection

<!-- Reflection prompt placeholder: add reflective question or remove section when not needed. -->

- How do you confirm if you got it right, and what’s your “second opinion plan” if you’re unsure?
- When would you push for immediate ED/cardiology consult in the field?
