# RSI vs DSI 

**Level:** Advanced
**Topic:** Airway Management
**Duration:** Deep Dive

***

## Arrival Scenario

EMS call: 38M, severe asthma, hypoxic, combative. Partner says, “We can’t oxygenate, but he’s fighting the mask.” Do you push RSI, or is this a “classic” DSI scenario—a patient too sick (and too combative) for regular preox, but too unstable for sedative/paralytic combo?

***

## Warm-Up Questions

1. What are the physiologic risks of full RSI in hypoxic or acidotic patients?
2. Name one “classic” DSI scenario by presentation, not definition.
3. Why do some severe hypoxic or tachypneic patients “crash” after paralyzing for tube?
4. How do you decide between pushing paralytics immediately or using DSI?
5. What does true preoxygenation mean for the failed airway?

## Explanation / Breakdown

### The RSI-DSI Spectrum

- **RSI (Rapid Sequence Intubation):**
    - Sedative immediately followed by paralytic; no bagging unless desaturation
    - Indication: Unresponsive or cooperative patient with airway threat but no time for awake technique
    - Risk: Apnea = crash desaturation if underlying shunt or low O₂ reserve
- **DSI (Delayed Sequence Intubation):**
    - Sedation (no paralytic) to allow preoxygenation in agitated, hypoxic/acidotic patient
    - Once preoxy achieved: THEN administer paralytic and proceed to intubate
    - Ideal for: Severe hypoxia, combative/AMS, status asthmaticus, intoxicated
    - Sedative of choice: Ketamine (preserves resp drive), precedes paralytic
- **Decision Factors:**
    - Extreme hypoxia (O₂ < 88%), major acidosis (pH <7.1), agitation + respiratory failure, severe shunt physiology
    - Check: “Will this person desaturate to the point of arrest if I paralyze right now?”


### Technical Steps

- **DSI:**

1. Monitor, IV/IO, capnography
2. Sedate (ketamine 1–2 mg/kg)
3. Preoxygenate (NRB/CPAP/BiPAP/high-flow NC)
4. Paralyze (rocuronium, succinylcholine)
5. Intubate quickly
- **RSI:**

1. Monitor, IV/IO, preoxygenate as able
2. Sedate then paralyze
3. Rapid intubation with no bagging

## Common Mistakes

- Skipping preoxygenation in “combative” patients—DSI buys you minutes to optimize, RSI may cost minutes to revive.
- Using benzos/propofol for DSI—these depress respiration.
- Delaying intubation in burn or facial trauma (“waiting for perfect preoxy”) when anatomy is closing fast.
- Over-bagging between sedative and paralytic.
- Not using ETCO₂ for real-time assessment during DSI.

***

## Clinical Pearls

- **DSI is for the hypoxic or acidotic patient who ‘needs a tube, but will die if paralyzed now.’**
- **Always optimize the patient before giving a paralytic—preoxy >95% if possible.**
- **Ketamine is the most airway/respiratory-friendly sedative for DSI.**
- **Don’t let “agitation” trick you—sometimes they’re simply hypoxic.**
- **RSI is more likely to cause cardiac arrest in sick lungs, low reserve, or severe shock.**

## Decision Trees

**Airway Management—Field Algorithm**

1. **Is the patient unresponsive, apneic, or GCS <8?**
    - Yes → RSI
2. **Is the patient combative, hypoxic, shutting down, but moving air?**
    - Yes → DSI: sedate first, oxygenate, then paralyze
3. **Is anatomy threatened/trauma/airway swelling?**
    - Yes → Fast as possible, cancel DSI delay, direct RSI
4. **Crash resuscitation needed during DSI?**
    - Yes → Revert to BVM, consider failure, move to advanced airway

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: Silent Asthmatic

- 29M, tripod, silent chest, O₂ 78%, fights mask.
- Timeline: 0min—scene, 5min—ketamine/sedation, 10min—O₂ 92% after NRB, RSI completed.
> What did DSI achieve that RSI would not?


### Case 2: Status Epilepticus

- 34F, seizing >10 min, O₂ dropping, BVM ineffective.
- Timeline: 0min—on call, 7min—post-ictal but hypoxic
> DSI or RSI, and why?


### Case 3: Septic Shock, Crash Airway

- 53M, delirious, breathing 40, O₂ 85%, acidotic.
- Timeline: 0min—arrival, 7min—lethargic but not comatose
> Preoxygenation/airway plan?


### Case 4: Facial Burn

- 40F, hoarse, blistered, stridor, O₂ 95%.
- Timeline: 0min—fire victim, 4min—airway narrowing, agitation.
> DSI vs RSI—what’s at stake?

## Reflection 

** Reflection Questions:**

- When would you abandon DSI for RSI (and vice versa) on a “gray zone” airway?
- What’s your sedation/preox protocol for the sickest airways you encounter?
- How can you improve your “backup plan” and team comms during DSI/Rapid Airway scenarios?
- When have you seen a poor outcome from an airway sequence choice?
