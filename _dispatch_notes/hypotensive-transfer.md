### **The Hypotensive Transfer That Wouldn't Behave**

*A quick reflection on shock index, permissive hypotension, volume expanders versus fluid resuscitation, and what to do differently and when.*

We’ve all been there. The call comes in as a "routine" interfacility transfer. This time, it was for a patient with persistent hypotension, destination: a higher level of care. "Easy enough," I thought. We'd get a report, hang a bag of fluid, and be on our way.

Then we met the patient.

The monitor lit up: BP 88/50, HR 112, RR 22\.

My first thought wasn't about the blood pressure—88 systolic is low, but it's not "on the floor." My first thought was about the relationship between the BP and the heart rate.

**Lesson 1: Trust the Shock Index (SI)**

The Shock Index (SI) is simple: Heart Rate divided by Systolic Blood Pressure. In a healthy adult, it should be between 0.5 and 0.7.

This patient's SI: 112 / 88 \= **1.27**.

Anytime the SI is creeping up toward 1.0 or higher, the patient is telling you they are in shock—even if the blood pressure looks deceptively "okay." That 112 heart rate wasn't just anxiety; it was the engine redlining to compensate for a failing system. This patient was already sick, and they were tired.

We started the transfer. Per the sending facility's orders, we had a bag of Normal Saline running. Ten minutes into the drive, the BP flashed 82/46. The heart rate ticked up to 118\.

My partner and I exchanged that look. This wasn't going to be a quiet ride.

**Lesson 2: Permissive Hypotension vs. Just Plain Hypotension**

I opened the IV wide for a 500cc bolus. It was an automatic reflex. Patient is hypotensive? Give fluid.

But what kind of shock were we treating?

The concept of **permissive hypotension** is drilled into us for trauma. In a patient with a suspected internal bleed, we intentionally keep the SBP around 80-90 mmHg. The idea is to not "pop the clot" by raising the pressure so high that we blow past the body's fragile attempt at hemostasis.

But this wasn't (as far as we knew) a trauma patient. This was a medical transfer. Was this sepsis? Cardiogenic shock? An occult bleed?

Giving that bolus was a gamble. If this was septic (distributive) shock, they needed the volume. If this was cardiogenic shock (a pump problem), that 500cc bols was just going to back up into their lungs.

The bolus finished. The BP came up to 90/52... for about three minutes. Then it slid back down to 80/44. The monitor beeped its complaint.

**Lesson 3: Volume Expanders vs. Fluid Resuscitation**

This was the key. Our patient was *not* responding to fluid. We weren't just "resuscitating" them; we were trying to fill a leaky, dilated tank. This is the critical difference between **fluid resuscitation** (filling an empty tank) and the need for **volume expanders** (i.e., vasopressors, which squeeze the tank).

This patient didn't just need *more* fluid; they needed their systemic vascular resistance (SVR) back. They needed pressors.

We were 20 minutes out. We had push-dose epinephrine in our kit, but I was hesitant. It's a bridge, and I wasn't sure what was on the other side. What if it *was* cardiogenic, and the epi would just make the strained heart work harder?

But the patient was becoming less responsive. The SI was now 124 / 78 \= **1.58**. This was a "now" problem.

We mixed the push-dose pressor. We gave 1mL.

The BP climbed to 94/56. The heart rate settled to 110\. The patient's eyes opened. They were still sick, but they were *back*. We gave another small bump five minutes later and rolled into the trauma bay with a pressure of 98/60 and a patient who could tell the nurse their name.

**What to Do Differently and When?**

Looking back, the "hypotensive transfer" label made me complacent.

1. **When the SI is \> 1.0,** my "routine" mindset needs to switch to "critical." I should have had my pressors drawn up and ready *before* we left the sending hospital.  
2. **A fluid challenge is a *test*, not just a treatment.** When that first 500cc bolus failed to produce a sustained (i.e., \>15 min) improvement, I should have immediately stopped thinking "more fluid" and started thinking "why did the fluid fail?"  
3. **Don't wait for the pressure to be 60/Palp.** The time to start pressors in non-traumatic, fluid-refractory shock is *before* the patient loses consciousness. That elevated Shock Index was the invitation. I should have accepted it sooner.

This call wasn't a failure, but it was messy. It was a reminder that the fundamentals—like the simple division of HR by SBP—are often the most powerful tools we have. And that sometimes, the most important intervention isn't another bag of fluid, but a few micrograms of something that tells the body to hold on.
