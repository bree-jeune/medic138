# Burns

**Level:** Intermediate  
**Topic:** Trauma / Emergency Medicine  
**Duration:** 60 minutes

---

## Arrival Scenario

You're dispatched to a house fire. A 45-year-old male self-extricated before your arrival. He's conscious, in severe pain, with burns covering both arms, his entire chest, and his face. His eyebrows are singed. He's coughing up black sputum.

Your partner starts calling out percentages. The patient's screaming. Bystanders are yelling. Everyone's asking you what to do.

**This is where burn assessment skills separate good medics from great ones.**

## Warm-Up Questions

Before we dive in, answer these:

1. **What's the Rule of Nines for adults?**
2. **What defines a superficial vs. partial-thickness vs. full-thickness burn?**
3. **What fluid resuscitation formula do you use for burns?**
4. **What are the signs of inhalation injury?**
5. **When does a burn patient need a burn center?**

Think it through. Burns are high-acuity, high-complexity calls.

## Explanation / Breakdown

### Burn Depth Classification

#### Superficial (First-Degree)
- **Damage:** Epidermis only
- **Appearance:** Red, painful, dry, no blisters
- **Example:** Mild sunburn
- **Heals:** 3-7 days, no scarring
- **Treatment:** Minor, doesn't count toward TBSA for fluid resuscitation

#### Partial-Thickness (Second-Degree)
**Superficial Partial:**
- **Damage:** Epidermis + upper dermis
- **Appearance:** Red, very painful, blisters, moist
- **Sensation:** Intact (extremely painful)
- **Heals:** 2-3 weeks, minimal scarring

**Deep Partial:**
- **Damage:** Epidermis + deep dermis
- **Appearance:** White/yellow, less painful, may blister
- **Sensation:** Decreased
- **Heals:** 3-8 weeks, significant scarring

#### Full-Thickness (Third-Degree)
- **Damage:** Entire dermis + subcutaneous tissue
- **Appearance:** White, brown, leathery, dry, charred
- **Sensation:** **Painless** (nerve endings destroyed)
- **Heals:** Does NOT heal on its own, needs grafting
- **Scarring:** Severe, contractures likely

#### Fourth-Degree
- **Damage:** Through skin into muscle, tendon, bone
- **Appearance:** Charred, black
- **Outcome:** Often requires amputation

### Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) Estimation

#### Rule of Nines (Adult)

| Body Region | Percentage |
|-------------|------------|
| Head & Neck | 9% |
| Each Arm | 9% (front and back) |
| Each Leg | 18% (front and back) |
| Anterior Trunk | 18% |
| Posterior Trunk | 18% |
| Perineum | 1% |

**Total = 100%**

#### Rule of Nines (Pediatric - Modified)

| Body Region | Infant/Child % |
|-------------|----------------|
| Head & Neck | 18% (larger head) |
| Each Arm | 9% |
| Each Leg | 14% (smaller legs) |
| Anterior Trunk | 18% |
| Posterior Trunk | 18% |
| Perineum | 1% |

#### Palm Method
- Patient's **palm = 1% TBSA**
- Useful for scattered burns
- Fingers NOT included (just the palm)

### Burn Center Criteria (ABA Guidelines)

Transfer to a burn center if:

1. **Partial-thickness > 10% TBSA**
2. **Full-thickness burns (any size)**
3. **Burns to face, hands, feet, genitals, perineum, major joints**
4. **Chemical burns**
5. **Electrical burns (including lightning)**
6. **Inhalation injury**
7. **Circumferential burns (extremity or chest)**
8. **Burns + trauma (burn injury poses greatest risk)**
9. **Burns in patients with significant comorbidities**
10. **Pediatric burns (if facility lacks pediatric expertise)**

### Fluid Resuscitation: Parkland Formula

**For burns > 20% TBSA in adults (>10% in children):**

**Parkland Formula:**  
**4 mL x weight (kg) x % TBSA = Total fluid in 24 hours**

**First 8 hours:** Give 50% of total  
**Next 16 hours:** Give remaining 50%

**Use Lactated Ringer's (LR) - NOT normal saline**

**Example:**  
70 kg patient, 30% TBSA burn  
4 x 70 x 30 = 8,400 mL in 24 hours  
First 8 hours: 4,200 mL (525 mL/hour)  
Next 16 hours: 4,200 mL (262 mL/hour)

**Start time = time of injury, not time of arrival**

### Inhalation Injury

**Suspect inhalation injury if:**
- Fire in enclosed space
- Facial burns
- Singed nasal hairs or eyebrows
- Carbonaceous sputum (black/sooty)
- Hoarseness, stridor, wheezing
- Respiratory distress
- Altered mental status (CO poisoning)

**Why it matters:**  
Inhalation injury increases mortality by 20%. Airway swelling can be rapid and catastrophic.

**Management:**
- High-flow O2 (100% NRB or BVM)
- Early intubation if any concern (don't wait for stridor)
- Large ETT (7.5-8.0) - swelling makes reintubation impossible
- Consider CO poisoning (check COHgb if able)

### Special Burn Types

#### Electrical Burns
- **Danger:** Internal damage far exceeds external burns
- **Complications:** Cardiac arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, compartment syndrome
- **Management:** Cardiac monitoring, aggressive fluids, check CK levels

#### Chemical Burns
- **Management:** Brush off dry powder FIRST, then irrigate copiously (20-30 min minimum)
- **Exception:** Elemental sodium/potassium (reacts with water - use oil-based coverage)
- **Don't neutralize** - causes exothermic reaction (more damage)

#### Circumferential Burns
- **Danger:** Acts like a tourniquet → compartment syndrome
- **Chest:** Restricts breathing → escharotomy needed
- **Extremity:** Cuts off circulation → escharotomy needed
- **Signs:** Decreased pulses, capillary refill, sensation, movement

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Including First-Degree Burns in TBSA
Superficial burns don't count toward fluid resuscitation calculations. Only partial and full-thickness.

### Mistake #2: Applying Ice or Cold Water
Causes hypothermia and worsens tissue damage. Use room-temperature water or saline-soaked dressings.

### Mistake #3: Delaying Intubation in Inhalation Injury
Airway swelling happens FAST. If you think they need a tube, they need it NOW.

### Mistake #4: Popping Blisters
Leave them intact. They're sterile and protective. Popping increases infection risk.

### Mistake #5: Under-Resuscitating
Burns need MASSIVE fluid volumes. Don't be shy with the LR.

### Mistake #6: Using Normal Saline Instead of LR
Parkland formula calls for Lactated Ringer's. NS can cause hyperchloremic acidosis.

### Mistake #7: Forgetting Pain Management
Burns are excruciating. Give opioids early and often (IV, titrated to effect).

## Clinical Pearls

💎 **If it doesn't hurt, it's worse.** Full-thickness burns are painless because nerves are destroyed.

💎 **Stridor = imminent airway loss.** Intubate immediately. You won't get a second chance.

💎 **CO poisoning is silent.** Pulse ox looks normal (can't differentiate COHgb). Trust the history and symptoms.

💎 **Remove rings, watches, belts immediately.** Swelling will make them tourniquets.

💎 **Estimate high, resuscitate to urine output.** Goal: 0.5-1 mL/kg/hr urine. Adjust fluids based on response.

💎 **Wet dressings for small burns, dry for large burns.** Large wet dressings = hypothermia.

💎 **Don't forget tetanus.** Burns are contaminated wounds.

💎 **Electrical burns → continuous cardiac monitoring.** Arrhythmias can occur hours later.

💎 **The Parkland formula is a starting point, not gospel.** Titrate to urine output and clinical response.

💎 **Burned kids decompensate fast.** Higher surface area-to-volume ratio = faster fluid loss and hypothermia.

    NO → Continue assessment
    ↓
Active burning? (clothing, chemicals)
    YES → Stop burning process (remove clothing, irrigate chemicals)
    NO → Continue
    ↓
ASSESS BURN
    ↓
Determine Depth:
    - Superficial (red, painful, dry)
    - Partial-thickness (blisters, moist, very painful)

    ↓
Any present?
    YES → Intubate immediately
        - Use large ETT (7.5-8.0)
        - May be difficult (swelling, secretions)
        - Get it on first attempt if possible
    NO → High-flow O2, close monitoring
        - Reassess every 5 minutes
        - Low threshold for intubation
        - Consider CO poisoning (confusion, HA, N/V)
    ↓

**Patient:** 32-year-old female, grease fire, burns to both arms (circumferential) and anterior chest  
**Exam:** Blisters, red, moist, extremely painful, crying  
**Vitals:** BP 142/88, HR 118, RR 22, SpO2 98% RA

**What's the TBSA and what's your treatment plan?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** 27% TBSA, partial-thickness burns, needs burn center

**TBSA Calculation:**
- Both arms: 9% + 9% = 18%
- Anterior chest: 9% (half of anterior trunk)
- **Total: 27%**

**Treatment Plan:**
- **Burn center criteria met** (>10% partial-thickness + circumferential)
- **IV access x2** (large-bore, 18G or larger)
- **Fluid resuscitation (Parkland):** 
  - Assume 60 kg = 4 x 60 x 27 = 6,480 mL over 24 hours
  - First 8 hours: 3,240 mL (405 mL/hr)
- **Pain management:** Morphine 2-4 mg IV, titrate
- **Remove jewelry immediately** (swelling will worsen)
- **Cover with dry sterile dressings**
- **Keep warm**
- **Continuous monitoring**
- **Transport to burn center**

</details>

### Case 2: The Enclosed Space Fire

**Patient:** 58-year-old male, pulled from burning bedroom, confused, coughing black sputum  
**Exam:** Burns to face, singed eyebrows/nasal hairs, hoarse voice  
**Vitals:** BP 158/92, HR 128, RR 28, SpO2 94% on NRB

**What's your biggest concern?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Inhalation injury with impending airway compromise

**Red Flags:**
- Enclosed space fire (smoke inhalation)
- Facial burns
- Singed hairs
- Carbonaceous sputum
- Hoarseness (laryngeal edema beginning)
- Confusion (possible CO poisoning)
- Increased respiratory rate

**Action:**
- **Intubate NOW** - Don't wait for stridor (that's a late sign)
- Use large ETT (7.5-8.0)
- 100% O2
- Aggressive fluid resuscitation (facial burns + possible CO)
- Consider CO poisoning (check COHgb if available)
- Burn center with hyperbaric O2 capability if COHgb >25%
- Continuous cardiac monitoring

**This patient will deteriorate rapidly. Early intubation saves lives.**

### Case 3: The Electrical Injury

**Patient:** 23-year-old male, contacted power line, entrance wound on right hand, exit wound on right foot  
**Exam:** Small charred areas on hand/foot, otherwise appears stable  
**Vitals:** BP 118/76, HR 102 (irregular), RR 16, SpO2 99% RA

**What are your concerns beyond the visible burns?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Internal tissue damage, cardiac arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, compartment syndrome

**Why:**
- Electrical current travels through body (not just surface)
- Damages muscle, nerves, vessels internally
- Entrance/exit wounds are just "tip of iceberg"
- High voltage = high risk

**Concerns:**
- **Cardiac:** Arrhythmias (note irregular HR), cardiac arrest
- **Muscle:** Rhabdomyolysis → myoglobin → renal failure
- **Compartment syndrome:** Swelling in fascial compartments
- **Neurological:** Spinal cord injury, peripheral nerve damage

**Action:**
- **Continuous cardiac monitoring** (watch for VF, VT, heart blocks)
- **Large-bore IV access**
- **Aggressive fluid resuscitation** (even with small surface burns)
  - Goal: Urine output 1-2 mL/kg/hr (higher than typical burns)
  - Dark urine = myoglobinuria
- **Check distal pulses, sensation, motor function** (compartment syndrome)
- **Transport to burn center** (all electrical burns qualify)
- **Labs:** CK, troponin, myoglobin, renal function

**Don't be fooled by small external burns. Electrical injuries kill from the inside.**

### Case 4: The Chemical Splash

**Patient:** 40-year-old industrial worker, sulfuric acid splashed on chest and abdomen  
**Scene:** Co-workers rinsed with water for ~2 minutes  
**Exam:** Red, painful, skin sloughing in areas

**What's your immediate action?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Continue irrigation, remove contaminated clothing, monitor for systemic effects

**Action:**
- **Continue irrigation** - 20-30 minutes minimum
  - Use copious amounts of water or saline
  - Brush off any dry chemical first (if powder)
- **Remove all clothing** (contaminated)
- **Protect yourself** - PPE, don't touch contaminated areas
- **Do NOT neutralize** - causes heat, more damage
- **Monitor airway** - chemical fumes can cause inhalation injury
- **Pain management** - chemical burns are extremely painful
- **IV access + fluids**
- **Transport to burn center** (all chemical burns qualify)

**Special Considerations:**
- Sulfuric acid = exothermic reaction (generates heat)
- Delayed tissue damage can occur (looks minor initially, worsens over hours)
- Check MSDS/hazmat info if available
- Consider systemic absorption (some chemicals absorbed through skin)

### Case 5: The Pediatric Burn

**Patient:** 3-year-old pulled pot of boiling water off stove, burns to face, anterior chest, and both arms  
**Exam:** Screaming, red/blistered skin, moist  
**Vitals:** HR 165, RR 38, crying

**What's the TBSA using pediatric Rule of Nines?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** 36% TBSA - this child is critically burned

**Pediatric TBSA Calculation:**
- Face: 9% (half of head/neck = 18%)
- Anterior chest: 18%
- Both arms: 9% + 9% = 18%
- **Total: 45%**

Wait - let's recalculate. If face only (not full head):
- Face: ~4.5% (quarter of head)
- Anterior chest: 18%
- Both arms: 9% + 9% = 18%
- **Total: 40.5%**

**Critical Points:**
- **>10% TBSA in child = burn center**
- **This child is in shock** (HR 165 is too high even for age/pain)
- **Massive fluid needs**

**Action:**
- **IO access if IV difficult** (don't delay)
- **Fluid resuscitation (Parkland):**
  - Estimate weight: 3 years old ~15 kg
  - 4 x 15 x 40 = 2,400 mL over 24 hours
  - First 8 hours: 1,200 mL (150 mL/hr)
- **Pain management:** Morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV/IO
- **Keep warm** (kids lose heat fast)
- **Calm child + parent** (if parent not injured)
- **Immediate transport to pediatric burn center**
- **Notify receiving facility early** (they need to mobilize resources)

**Outcome depends on speed of resuscitation and specialized care.**

## Reflection

You just learned how to assess, calculate, and manage burn patients in the field.

Here's what you should be able to do now:

✅ Classify burn depth (superficial, partial, full-thickness)  
✅ Estimate TBSA using Rule of Nines and Palm Method  
✅ Calculate Parkland formula for fluid resuscitation  
✅ Recognize inhalation injury and manage airway  
✅ Identify burn center criteria  
✅ Understand special burn types (electrical, chemical, circumferential)  
✅ Avoid common mistakes that worsen outcomes  

**Next-level thinking:**
- How does altitude/environment affect burn management?
- What's the pathophysiology of burn shock?
- When do you perform an escharotomy in the field?
- How do you manage mass-casualty burn incidents?

**Your assignment:**  
Practice TBSA estimation on every burn you see—even minor ones. Draw the Rule of Nines on your partner. Make it automatic. Because when you're standing in front of a critical burn, you won't have time to second-guess your math.

Burns are unforgiving. Learn them cold.
