# Toxicology

**Level:** Advanced
**Topic:** Poisoning, Overdose, Critical Care
**Duration:** Deep Dive

***

## Arrival Scenario

“Unresponsive, bottle of pills.” You find a 34F, pinpoint pupils, slow and shallow breathing, O₂ 88%. Family mentions “opioids + something else.”
Do you give naloxone, bag, or both? How do you screen for deadly coinfection, and what patterns tell you the true tox priority?

***

## Warm-Up Questions

1. What are the most lethal toxidromes in adults?
2. Name the go-to “antidote” therapies in the prehospital world.
3. How do you recognize “dirty” vs. “clean” toxidromes on exam?
4. When is naloxone risky rather than routine?
5. How can you CYA for poisons with no field antidote?

## Explanation / Breakdown

### High-Risk Toxidromes

- **Opioid:** Pinpoint, slow RR, track marks, low O₂—give naloxone in minimum increments
- **Sympathomimetic:** Agitated, high BP/HR/temp, dilated pupils, diaphoresis (cocaine, amphetamines)
- **Anticholinergic:** Dry, hot, red, blind, mad (antihistamines, TCAs)
- **Cholinergic:** Wet, brady/drool/diarrhea (organophosphates, cholinesterase inhibitors)
- **Sedative-hypnotic:** Depressed—alcohol, benzos, barbiturates; airway priority
- **Serotonin syndrome:** Clonus, hyperreflexia, HTN, fever, agitation; often drug interaction


### Key Actions

- **Airway, breathing, circulation**: first and always
- **Targeted antidotes**
    - Naloxone for opioid (low/slow dosing)
    - Benzos for sympathomimetic or withdrawal
    - Atropine/pralidoxime for cholinergic
    - Sodium bicarb for wide-QRS TCA
    - Supportive for all others

***

## Common Mistakes

- Blindly giving naloxone (risk: pulmonary edema, withdrawal arrest).
- Missed polydrug ingestion, interaction.
- Delaying airway management for “antidote” effect.

***

## Clinical Pearls

- Two vital signs + constricted pupils = opioid until proven otherwise.
- Wide QRS in a tox patient? Push sodium bicarb (TCA, Na-channel).
- Don’t overlook heating pads, eye drops, or flea collars—cholinergic!
- Always bring the bottle(s)—treatment can change with new information on scene.

## Decision Trees

**Toxicology Field Approach**

1. **Is airway threatened or breathing slow?**
    - Yes → Bag/mask first, then consider antidote
2. **Toxidrome clear?**
    - Yes → Treat per pattern/antidote
    - No → Supportive care, decontaminate as permitted
3. **QRS wide, seizures, dysrhythmias?**
    - Yes → Sodium bicarb, benzos, rapid transport

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: Poly-Opioid

- 34F, O₂ 88%, RR 6, pinpoint.
> Naloxone or airway first, why?


### Case 2: Stimulant ODs

- 22M, hyperthermic, agitated, HR 168, no trauma, dilated pupils.
> What meds buy time, and what to avoid?

***

## Reflection

- How do you “pattern recognize” tox from unknowns or “mystery collapse”?
- What’s your airway/antidote sequence for high-risk overdose?
