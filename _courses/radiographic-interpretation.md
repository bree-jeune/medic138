# Radiographic Interpretation

**Level:** Advanced
**Topic:** Imaging · EMS/Critical Care
**Duration:** Deep Dive

***

## Arrival Scenario

Facility calls for help moving a trauma patient coded as “not stable for CT scan.” X-ray available, not read; late at night, and the hospitalist asks “what’s your impression?"
You know: pattern recognition on radiographs is a must—even for medics. Missed pneumothorax or aortic injury kills fast.
What are your field interpretation essentials?

***

## Warm-Up Questions

1. On a supine chest X-ray, what’s the most subtle sign of a pneumothorax?
2. Which fracture patterns on pelvic X-ray signal “can’t-miss” bleeding risk?
3. What should you look for on a lateral c-spine view before moving a trauma patient?
4. Which foreign body on x-ray is a “true” surgical emergency?
5. Why check the costophrenic angle on every chest X-ray?

## Explanation / Breakdown

### Field Radiograph Essentials

- **Chest X-ray:**
    - *Pneumothorax*: Deep sulcus sign, absence of vascular markings, shifted mediastinum
    - *Hemothorax*: Blunting of costophrenic angle, opacity
    - *Rib fractures*: Look for underlying contusion/pneumo; >3 = high morbidity
    - *ETT/NGT/lines*: Location relative to carina, midline, below diaphragm
- **Pelvis:**
    - *Open book*, vertical shear, displaced rami—signal life-threatening hemorrhage
    - Possible bladder or urethral injury (pubic rami fracture + blood at meatus)
- **Cervical spine:**
    - Step-offs, non-aligned vertebrae, loss of normal curvature, prevertebral swelling
    - Assess all seven vertebrae, including corners of film
- **Abdomen:**
    - Free air = perforation (look under each diaphragm, “football sign” in kids)
    - Foreign bodies: coin orientation, battery “double ring,” sharp objects

## Common Mistakes

- Overlooking subtle “deep sulcus” pneumothorax on supine chest films
- Failing to check tube/line placement before transport
- Ignoring pelvic fracture “open book” sign—risk of massive bleed
- Dismissing a negative FAST if X-ray shows free air after trauma

***

## Clinical Pearls

- *Look for lines first:* Confirm ETT, NGT, chest tubes, and central lines are in correct position before moving/transport.
- *Supine chest films*: Air may track to anterior/lateral chest—classic “deep sulcus” rather than apex signs.
- Any infraclavicular, perihilar, or right main bronchus tube = malposition until proven otherwise.
- Rib series: >3 fractures, flail segment = watch for delayed pulmonary decline.
- Any misshaped vertebral body or prevertebral swelling in trauma = maintain full C-spine until cleared.

## Decision Trees

**Radiograph Quick Scan Algorithm**

1. **Life threat visible?**
    - Yes → Pneumothorax/hemothorax: Prep chest tube/thoracostomy
    - Major fracture: Immediate immobilization, massive transfusion readiness
2. **Tube or line abnormal?**
    - Yes → Correct/reposition, alert receiving team, reassess before moving
3. **Cervical spine not cleared?**
    - Yes → Continue immobilization and reassessment during transfer

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: Supine Pneumothorax

- 55M, blunt trauma, chest X-ray: right deep sulcus, minimal vascular markings.
- Timeline: 0min—read, 8min—SpO₂ drops, RR rises
> Action?


### Case 2: Malpositioned ETT

- 44M, intubated, film: tube tip at T2, deviated left.
- Timeline: 0min—check, 5min—hypoxia worsens
> Correction and recheck steps?


### Case 3: Open Book Pelvis

- 32F, high-speed MVC, pelvic fracture, pubic symphysis widened.
- Timeline: 0min—found, 12min—hypotension, GCS falls
> Field priorities?


### Case 4: Foreign Body Ingestion

- 6M, coin ingested.
- Timeline: 0min—CXR, AP: coin in upper esophagus
> OR vs. observation? Key detail?


### Case 5: Blunt Abdominal Trauma

- 67M, peritonitis, chest and abdominal films: free air beneath diaphragm.
- Timeline: 0min—X-ray, 5min—pressure drop
> Next clinical steps?

## Reflection

** Reflection Questions:**

- What X-ray sign would make you change your plan without waiting for radiology?
- How do you double-check hidden soft anatomy (costophrenic, retrocardiac spaces)?
- What’s your “tube check” protocol before/after every move?
- Which fracture or abnormality always prompts you to slow down—even if everyone else is rushing?
