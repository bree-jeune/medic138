# Lab Values for Flight and Critical Care

**Level:** Advanced
**Topic:** Critical Care, Lab Interpretation
**Duration:** Deep Dive
*FP-C/CCP-C Exam Prep · High-signal pattern recognition for patient management*

***

## Arrival Scenario

You're on a flight call for a septic patient. Handover includes a labs printout: lactate 5.6, WBC 19.1, K+ 5.2, hemoglobin 13, INR 2.9, and a creatinine trending up. The nurse tells you, "Labs aren't great—keep an eye on the kidneys."
The next thirty minutes could mean crashing or stabilizing.
**Your real-world question:** Which lab trends actually matter at altitude, and how do you interpret shifts during flight or high-acuity transfer?

***

## Warm-Up Questions

1. Which three labs should trigger an immediate recheck during transport?
2. What systemic dangers are associated with a rapidly rising lactate?
3. How could altitude or movement impact your labs assessment on a flight?
4. What’s the difference between a “critical value” and one you can monitor?
5. How does abnormal potassium affect your cardiac management in-flight?

## Explanation / Breakdown

### **Crucial Labs – What They Mean in the Field**

| Lab | Normal Range | Field Meaning |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Sodium | 135–145 mEq/L | <135: Neuro, seizure risk; >145: Fluid overload |
| Potassium | 3.5–5.0 mEq/L | <3.5: Arrhythmia risk; >5: Peaked T's/Vfib |
| Calcium | 8.5–10.5 mg/dL | <8.5: Tetany, QT prolong; >10.5: Cardiac arrest |
| Mag | 1.7–2.2 mg/dL | <1.7: Torsades, seizures; >2.2: Weakness |
| Glucose | 70–110 mg/dL | <70: Coma risk; >250: DKA risk |
| Lactate | <2.0 mmol/L | >2.5: Shock/hypoperfusion |
| Hemoglobin | 12–16 g/dL (W) | <7: Critical O₂ risk; >20: Dehydration risk |
| Hematocrit | 36–45% (W) | Low: Bleeding/massive transfusion alert |
| Platelets | 150–450 x10³/uL | <50: Spontaneous bleed risk |
| INR | 0.9–1.1 (nml) | >1.5: Bleed risk, transport trauma risk |
| Creatinine | 0.7–1.3 mg/dL | Rising: AKI/shock/kidney failure |
| Troponin | <0.04 ng/mL | >0.04: Ongoing cardiac muscle injury |
| pH (ABG) | 7.35–7.45 | <7.2: Metabolic collapse risk |

> **Note:** Trends matter. Single “high” or “low” often less important than direction and speed of change.[^1][^2][^3]

### **Interpreting Labs—The Streetwise Way**

- **Critical values:** Labs outside safe “operational” range requiring *immediate* action. (e.g., K+ >6.0, lactate >4.0, glucose <50)
- **Trends:** Increasing lactate, rising creatinine, dropping hemoglobin signal deteriorating status, even if “not critical.”
- **Context is king:** *Any abnormal must be checked against clinical story and timeline.* High INR after trauma = high bleeding risk; high K+ in cardiac arrest = direct defibrillation impact.
- **Labs in Transport:** Always consider delays, lab draw timing, and instrument variation between facilities.[^4]


### **High-Risk Patterns**

- Lactate >4 + downtrending BP: Shock!
- K+ >5.5 + peaked T waves: Vfib/VT risk!
- INR >3 + new bruising: Bleeding or DIC!
- Creatinine rising >2.0: AKI, need careful fluid/titration management.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating a single abnormal lab in isolation—always trend and clinical context.
- Ignoring lab value changes due to hemolysis, transport delays, or sample error.
- Failing to recheck K+ and glucose in unstable patients during long transfer.
- Fixating on “normal” when patient is crashing: *pattern and progression > absolute values*
- Not communicating critical/panic values to accepting MD pre-arrival.

***

## Clinical Pearls

- *Most abnormal labs don’t need panic—unless patient’s clinical pattern matches the risk.*
- Creatinine trend can signal AKI before urine volume drops; act on the *trend*, not just single numbers.
- Always double check ABG/K+ on any intubated, unstable, or post-arrest transfer.
- INR, platelets, and hemoglobin: This triad is your “bleeding risk radar” for any patient at altitude or with trauma.
- Lactate is a marker for perfusion, not “sepsis alone”—if rising, something in the body is losing O₂.

## Decision Trees

**Critical Lab Alerts in Flight/Critical Care:**

1. Is a lab value flagged as “critical”?
    - Yes → Reassess patient, notify receiving/medical control, prepare immediate intervention.
    - No → Trend labs and reassess clinical pattern.
2. Is patient’s status *deteriorating* alongside lab changes?
    - Yes → Recheck values, escalate care, prep for emergent intervention in flight.
    - No → Monitor, communicate findings on arrival, adjust therapy only as needed.
3. Are there confounding factors (hemolysis, dehydration, recent treatment)?
    - Yes → Seek additional labs or recheck.
    - No → Rely on lab-clinical integration.

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: High Lactate, Low BP

- 64F, septic shock, ground lactate 5.2 → 7.1 in 30 min. BP trending down.
- Timeline: 0 min—takeoff, 15 min—lactate check, 25 min—hypotension, 30 min—vasopressors needed.
- Vitals: HR 112, BP 78/46, SpO₂ 95%, U/O low
> Management priorities? What’s worsening?


### Case 2: Peaked T-Waves on Monitor

- 33M, DKA, K+ 6.6, BG 505, “V-tach alarm” at cruise.
- Timeline: 0 min—takeoff, 10 min—cardiac alarm, 13 min—K+ recheck.
- Vitals: HR 128, BP 90/56, SpO₂ 90%, Temp 35.7°C
> Cardiac risk? Immediate actions?


### Case 3: Rising Creatinine

- 42F, post-arrest, Cr 1.5 on ground, 2.1 after 20 min flight.
- Timeline: 0 min—takeoff, 20 min—lab check, 35 min—decreased urine, high BP.
- Vitals: HR 102, BP 118/72, SpO₂ 97%, U/O minimal
> Why is this a problem? Interventions?


### Case 4: Bleeding Risk

- 59M, GI bleed, INR 3.2, platelets 65. “Oozing” at IV sites mid-flight.
- Timeline: 0 min—takeoff, 12 min—increasing ooze, 18 min—BP drop.
- Vitals: HR 106, BP 88/64, SpO₂ 98%, U/O stable
> Bleeding risk pattern? Steps?


### Case 5: Glucose Extremes

- 78F, altered, BG 37. Treated, BG 250 after 20 min. Re-altered post-treatment.
- Timeline: 0 min—takeoff, 8 min—hypoglycemia, 20 min—hyperglycemia, 30 min—symptoms recur.
- Vitals: HR 80, BP 100/62, SpO₂ 97%, Temp 36.5°C
> What went wrong in management? Monitoring needed?


### Case 6: Low Calcium, Seizures

- 18M, trauma, Ca 7.0, tetany, short QT, seizure incurred in air.
- Timeline: 0 min—takeoff, 15 min—muscle twitch, 22 min—seizure onset.
- Vitals: HR 116, BP 130/78, SpO₂ 95%, U/O normal
> Connection? Immediate fix?

## Reflection

<!-- Reflection prompt placeholder: add reflective question or remove section when not needed. -->

**Structured Reflection Questions:**

- Which lab values are your biggest blind spots, and where do you need more pattern drills?
- Recall a case (real or scenario) where labs changed your clinical approach—what made the difference?
- How will you quickly convey “lab story” to a receiving team, especially if values update mid-flight?
- If you could tell a new flight medic the “dirty dozen” most critical labs, which would you pick?
