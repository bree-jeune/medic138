# Fetal Monitoring

**Level:** Advanced  
**Topic:** Obstetrics / Critical Care Transport  
**Duration:** 60 minutes

---

## Arrival Scenario

You're transporting a 32-year-old G2P1 at 36 weeks gestation from a rural hospital to a tertiary center. She's on magnesium for severe preeclampsia. BP 168/102, contracting every 3-4 minutes.

The nurse hands you a fetal monitor strip: "Baseline's 155, but I'm seeing some decels. Keep an eye on it."

You look at the strip. The pattern is unmistakable.

**And you know exactly what it means.**

---

## Warm-Up Questions

Before we interpret strips, answer these:

1. **What's a normal fetal heart rate range?**
2. **What are the three types of decelerations?**
3. **What does variability tell you about the fetus?**
4. **What's the difference between early and late decelerations?**
5. **When is a fetal heart tracing considered non-reassuring?**

Think it through. Fetal monitoring isn't guessing—it's pattern recognition.

## Explanation / Breakdown

### Normal Fetal Heart Rate Parameters

**Baseline FHR:**
- **Normal:** 110-160 bpm
- **Tachycardia:** > 160 bpm
- **Bradycardia:** < 110 bpm

**Variability (Beat-to-Beat Fluctuations):**
- **Absent:** Amplitude range undetectable
- **Minimal:** ≤ 5 bpm amplitude
- **Moderate (Normal):** 6-25 bpm amplitude
- **Marked:** > 25 bpm amplitude

**Why variability matters:**  
Variability = healthy fetal autonomic nervous system. Moderate variability = reassuring. Absent variability = concerning (fetal distress, hypoxia, or meds).

### Accelerations

**What they are:** Temporary increase in FHR above baseline

**Criteria:**
- Peak ≥ 15 bpm above baseline
- Duration ≥ 15 seconds (but < 2 minutes)
- < 32 weeks: peak ≥ 10 bpm, duration ≥ 10 seconds

**What they mean:** **REASSURING** - indicates fetal well-being

**Seen with:** Fetal movement, contractions, stimulation

### Decelerations

#### Early Decelerations
**Pattern:**
- **Gradual** decrease (onset to nadir ≥ 30 seconds)
- **Mirrors contraction** (starts with contraction, nadir at peak of contraction, returns to baseline as contraction ends)
- Returns to baseline by end of contraction
- Usually shallow (rarely < 100 bpm)

**Cause:** Fetal head compression → vagal response

**Significance:** **BENIGN** - normal physiologic response

**Management:** None needed

#### Variable Decelerations
**Pattern:**
- **Abrupt** decrease (onset to nadir < 30 seconds)
- **Variable** timing relative to contractions (no consistent pattern)
- Variable depth and duration
- Rapid return to baseline (usually)
- Often V-shaped or W-shaped

**Cause:** Umbilical cord compression

**Significance:**
- **Mild:** Reassuring if brief, moderate variability maintained
- **Moderate/Severe:** Concerning if prolonged, deep, or repetitive

**Management:**
- Reposition mother (left lateral, right lateral, knee-chest)
- O2 (non-rebreather)
- IV fluids
- Discontinue oxytocin if running
- Vaginal exam (check for cord prolapse)
- Notify physician

#### Late Decelerations
**Pattern:**
- **Gradual** decrease (onset to nadir ≥ 30 seconds)
- **Delayed** relative to contraction (nadir occurs AFTER peak of contraction)
- Slow return to baseline (after contraction ends)
- Persistent pattern (repetitive)
- Often subtle (may only drop 10-20 bpm)

**Cause:** Uteroplacental insufficiency → fetal hypoxia

**Significance:** **OMINOUS** - indicates fetal compromise

**Management:**
- Reposition mother (left lateral - improve placental perfusion)
- High-flow O2
- IV fluid bolus
- Stop oxytocin
- Check maternal BP (hypotension worsens placental perfusion)
- Vaginal exam (rapid labor? abruption?)
- Prepare for emergency delivery if persistent
- Notify physician immediately

#### Prolonged Decelerations
**Pattern:**
- Decrease ≥ 15 bpm below baseline
- Duration ≥ 2 minutes but < 10 minutes
- Abrupt or gradual

**Cause:**
- Cord compression/prolapse
- Maternal hypotension
- Uterine hypertonicity
- Rapid descent
- Placental abruption
- Uterine rupture

**Significance:** **CONCERNING** - requires immediate evaluation

**Management:**
- Reposition
- O2
- IV fluids
- Vaginal exam (cord prolapse?)
- Stop oxytocin
- Check maternal status (BP, bleeding, pain)
- Prepare for emergency delivery if doesn't resolve

### Fetal Heart Rate Categories (NICHD)

#### Category I (Normal - Reassuring)
- Baseline 110-160 bpm
- Moderate variability
- No late or variable decelerations
- Accelerations present (not required)
- Early decelerations present or absent

**Action:** Routine monitoring

#### Category II (Indeterminate)
- Everything that doesn't fit Category I or III
- Examples:
  - Minimal or marked variability
  - Tachycardia without variability
  - Variable decelerations with moderate variability
  - Recurrent variable decelerations with minimal/absent variability

**Action:** Continue monitoring, implement interventions, reassess

#### Category III (Abnormal - Non-Reassuring)
- Absent variability AND any of:
  - Recurrent late decelerations
  - Recurrent variable decelerations
  - Bradycardia
- Sinusoidal pattern

**Action:** Immediate intervention, prepare for emergent delivery

### Causes of FHR Abnormalities

**Tachycardia (> 160 bpm):**
- Maternal fever/infection
- Fetal hypoxia (early sign)
- Medications (terbutaline, atropine)
- Fetal arrhythmia
- Maternal hyperthyroidism
- Chorioamnionitis

**Bradycardia (< 110 bpm):**
- Fetal hypoxia (late sign)
- Cord compression/prolapse
- Maternal hypotension
- Medications (beta-blockers)
- Fetal heart block
- Placental abruption

**Decreased Variability:**
- Fetal sleep cycle (20-40 min)
- Fetal hypoxia
- Medications (magnesium, opioids, sedatives)
- Prematurity (< 28 weeks)
- Fetal neurological abnormality

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Confusing Early and Late Decelerations
Timing is everything. Early = mirrors contraction. Late = delayed, nadir after peak.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Subtle Late Decelerations
Late decels don't have to be dramatic. Even small drops (10-15 bpm) are significant if repetitive and late.

### Mistake #3: Assuming All Variable Decelerations Are Benign
Mild, brief variables with good variability = okay. Deep, prolonged, repetitive variables = cord compression.

### Mistake #4: Not Repositioning the Mother
Left lateral position improves placental perfusion. Always try repositioning first.

### Mistake #5: Missing Absent Variability
Flat baseline = concerning (unless explained by sleep cycle or meds). Don't ignore it.

### Mistake #6: Over-Relying on Doppler When Strip Is Available
Continuous monitoring gives you variability and decelerations. Doppler just gives you a number.

## Clinical Pearls

💎 **Moderate variability is the most reassuring sign.** Even with decelerations, if variability is moderate, the fetus is compensating.

💎 **Late decelerations = placental insufficiency.** Think hypoxia. Act fast.

💎 **Variable decelerations = cord compression.** Reposition mother. Check for prolapse.

💎 **Early decelerations = head compression.** Benign. Don't panic.

💎 **Absent variability + recurrent decels = Category III.** This baby needs out NOW.

💎 **Sinusoidal pattern = severe fetal anemia or hypoxia.** Smooth, undulating baseline with no variability. Ominous.

💎 **Fetal tachycardia + decreased variability = hypoxia.** Don't wait for bradycardia.

💎 **Left lateral position is your first intervention.** It improves placental perfusion by relieving aortocaval compression.

💎 **O2 helps mom (and therefore baby).** 100% O2 via NRB if fetal distress suspected.

💎 **Prolonged deceleration > 10 minutes = bradycardia** (new baseline). This is bad.

### Management of Non-Reassuring Fetal Heart Tracing

```
Non-Reassuring Pattern Identified
(Late Decels, Severe Variables, Absent Variability + Decels)
    ↓
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
    ↓
1. Reposition Mother
   - Left lateral (first choice)
   - If no improvement → right lateral or knee-chest

   - 100% via NRB
   - 10-15 L/min

3. IV Fluid Bolus
   - 500-1000 mL NS or LR
   - Improve maternal BP → improve placental perfusion

4. Stop Oxytocin (if running)
   - Decreased contractions → improved placental perfusion

   - Assess cervical dilation (rapid delivery?)

6. Check Maternal Status
   - BP (hypotension?)
   - Bleeding (abruption?)
   - Pain (rupture?)
   - Contractions (hypertonicity?)

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: The Late Decelerations

**Patient:** 28-year-old G1P0 at 39 weeks, laboring  
**Strip:** Baseline 145 bpm, minimal variability, repetitive gradual decelerations starting 20-30 seconds after contraction begins, nadir 10-15 seconds after peak of contraction, slow return to baseline

**What's the pattern and what do you do?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Late Decelerations - indicates uteroplacental insufficiency and fetal hypoxia

**Why:**
- Gradual decrease (onset to nadir ≥ 30 seconds)
- Delayed relative to contraction (nadir AFTER contraction peak)
- Repetitive pattern
- Minimal variability makes this more concerning

**Category:** II-III (depending on persistence)

**Action:**
1. **Reposition to left lateral immediately**
2. **100% O2 via NRB**
3. **IV fluid bolus** (500-1000 mL)
4. **Stop oxytocin** (if running)
5. Check maternal BP (hypotension worsens placental perfusion)
6. Notify physician
7. Prepare for potential emergency delivery
8. Continue close monitoring

**This is a CONCERNING pattern. Late decelerations indicate the fetus isn't getting enough oxygen during contractions. Intervention is urgent.**

</details>

### Case 2: The Variable Decelerations

**Patient:** 32-year-old G3P2 at 38 weeks, active labor  
**Strip:** Baseline 150 bpm, moderate variability, abrupt V-shaped decelerations dropping to 90-100 bpm, occurring at variable times relative to contractions, rapid return to baseline

**What's happening?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Variable Decelerations - indicates umbilical cord compression

**Why:**
- Abrupt decrease (onset to nadir < 30 seconds)
- Variable timing (no consistent relationship to contractions)
- V-shaped pattern
- Rapid recovery
- Moderate variability maintained = reassuring

**Category:** II (Indeterminate)

**Significance:**
- Mild to moderate variables with good variability = usually tolerated
- Cord compression common in labor (cord wrapped, nuchal cord)
- Not immediately dangerous if brief and baby recovers

**Action:**
1. **Reposition mother** (left lateral, right lateral, knee-chest)
   - Changes position of cord
2. **Vaginal exam** (rule out cord prolapse - emergent if present)
3. **O2 if deepening or prolonged**
4. **Continue close monitoring**
5. If worsening (deeper, longer, loss of variability):
   - IV fluids
   - Notify physician
   - Consider amnioinfusion (if available - adds fluid around cord)

**Most variable decels resolve with repositioning. Close monitoring is key.**

</details>

### Case 3: The Flat Line

**Patient:** 26-year-old G2P1 at 37 weeks, preeclampsia on magnesium sulfate  
**Strip:** Baseline 155 bpm, **absent variability** (flat baseline), no decelerations, no accelerations

**Is this concerning?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Yes, concerning - but consider magnesium effect vs. fetal compromise

**Why:**
- Absent variability = loss of beat-to-beat fluctuations
- Can indicate:
  - Fetal hypoxia (bad)
  - Fetal sleep cycle (20-40 min - benign)
  - Magnesium sulfate effect (medication)
  - Opioid administration (medication)
  - Prematurity (< 28 weeks)

**In this case:** Magnesium sulfate commonly decreases variability

**Category:** II (Indeterminate)

**Action:**
1. **Check how long variability has been absent**
   - < 40 minutes + no decels = may be sleep cycle or mag effect
   - > 40 minutes = more concerning
2. **Stimulate fetus** (if in hospital: vibroacoustic stimulation)
3. **Check magnesium level** (toxicity?)
4. **Monitor closely for decelerations**
   - Absent variability ALONE = concerning
   - Absent variability + LATE DECELS = CATEGORY III (emergency)
5. **Notify physician**
6. **Prepare for potential delivery**

**Absent variability requires close monitoring. If decelerations develop, this becomes an emergency.**

</details>

---

### Case 4: The Prolonged Deceleration

**Patient:** 35-year-old G4P3 at 40 weeks, rapid labor  
**Strip:** Baseline was 140 bpm with moderate variability, suddenly drops to 80 bpm and stays there for 4 minutes

**What's your immediate action?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Prolonged Deceleration - immediate intervention required

**Why:**
- Deceleration ≥ 15 bpm below baseline
- Duration ≥ 2 minutes (but < 10 minutes)
- Causes include:
  - Cord prolapse/compression (check NOW)
  - Maternal hypotension
  - Uterine hypertonicity
  - Rapid descent
  - Placental abruption
  - Uterine rupture

**This is an EMERGENCY until proven otherwise.**

**Action:**
1. **IMMEDIATE vaginal exam** (check for cord prolapse)
   - If cord palpated: push presenting part up, knee-chest position, emergent delivery
2. **Reposition mother** (left lateral, right lateral, knee-chest)
3. **100% O2**
4. **IV fluid bolus**
5. **Stop oxytocin** (if running)
6. **Check maternal status:**
   - BP (hypotension?)
   - Bleeding (abruption?)
   - Pain (rupture?)
7. **Call for help**
8. **Prepare for emergency delivery** (if doesn't resolve in minutes)

**Monitor closely:**
- If FHR returns to baseline with moderate variability → continue close monitoring
- If remains low or develops absent variability → EMERGENT DELIVERY

**Prolonged decelerations are a warning sign. Act fast.**

</details>

---

### Case 5: The Sinusoidal Pattern

**Patient:** 30-year-old G2P1 at 36 weeks, motor vehicle collision 2 hours ago, abdominal pain  
**Strip:** Smooth, undulating sine-wave pattern, baseline 150 bpm, amplitude 5-10 bpm, no variability, no accelerations

**What does this pattern indicate?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Sinusoidal Pattern - indicates severe fetal anemia or hypoxia (OMINOUS)

**Why:**
- Sinusoidal = smooth, undulating pattern like a sine wave
- Absent true variability
- Fixed cycle frequency (3-5 cycles per minute)
- Associated with:
  - **Severe fetal anemia** (most common - Rh isoimmunization, fetomaternal hemorrhage)
  - Severe fetal hypoxia
  - Fetal acidosis
- In trauma patient with abdominal pain: **think fetomaternal hemorrhage or placental abruption**

**Category:** III (Abnormal - Non-Reassuring)

**Action:**
1. **Notify physician IMMEDIATELY**
2. **Prepare for EMERGENT DELIVERY**
3. **High-flow O2**
4. **IV access x2, large-bore**
5. **Type and cross** (prepare for transfusion)
6. **Kleihauer-Betke test** (quantify fetomaternal hemorrhage)
7. **Continuous fetal monitoring**
8. **Monitor mother for abruption** (vaginal bleeding, rigid abdomen, shock)
9. **Expedite transport**

**This pattern indicates severe fetal compromise. Delivery is often needed urgently.**

**Post-trauma patients: sinusoidal pattern + abdominal pain = abruption or fetomaternal hemorrhage until proven otherwise.**

## Reflection

Fetal monitoring is about pattern recognition and understanding what the fetus is telling you.

Here's what you should know:

✅ Normal baseline FHR: 110-160 bpm  
✅ Moderate variability is the most reassuring finding  
✅ Early decels = benign (head compression)  
✅ Variable decels = cord compression (reposition)  
✅ Late decels = hypoxia (immediate intervention)  
✅ Absent variability + decels = Category III (emergency)  
✅ Sinusoidal pattern = severe anemia/hypoxia (ominous)  

**Next-level thinking:**
- How do you interpret fetal monitoring in preterm labor?
- What's the role of fetal scalp stimulation in assessment?
- When is intrauterine resuscitation appropriate?
- How does maternal positioning affect placental perfusion?

**Your assignment:**  
Review fetal monitoring strips. Practice identifying baselines, variability, accelerations, and the three types of decelerations. Pattern recognition takes repetition.

Because when you're transporting a laboring mother, you need to know what that strip is telling you—before it's too late.
