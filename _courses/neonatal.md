# Neonatal Emergencies

**Level:** Advanced
**Topic:** Neonatology · Critical Care · EMS/Flight
**Duration:** Deep Dive

***

## Arrival Scenario

You intercept a transfer of a 2-day-old with "blue spells" and poor feeding. The nurse reports rapid breathing, weak cry, and the infant cool to touch. In the field, there’s no room for error—every minute that passes matters more.
What systems are at risk, and what are the sequenced actions that matter most before you ever roll?

***

## Warm-Up Questions

1. What vital sign outside adult norms should always alarm you in neonates?
2. Which “blue baby” patterns point toward cardiac, not pulmonary, emergencies?
3. What is the window for effective glucose correction in a seizing neonate?
4. How can hypothermia worsen every neonatal crisis?
5. Why is early airway management both essential and high-risk in neonates?

## Explanation / Breakdown

### Most Common and Lethal Neonatal Emergencies

- **Respiratory distress**
    - Grunting, nasal flaring, chest wall retractions, cyanosis (“see-saw” breathing)
    - Airway: tiny, high risk for mucus plugs or obstruction
- **Shock**
    - Tachycardia, cool clammy skin, delayed cap refill, hypotension is late; perfusion far more important than BP
- **Congenital Heart Disease ("ductal dependent")**
    - Cyanosis unresponsive to O₂, differential cyanosis, murmurs
    - Prostaglandin E₁ is life-saving; never withhold if suspecting a ductal-dependent lesion
- **Sepsis**
    - Subtle: poor feeding, weak cry, lethargy, hypothermia (fever is rare)
    - Rapid decompensation, wide temp swings
- **Hypoglycemia**
    - Jittery, lethargic, weak suck, apnea, seizure
    - BG < 45–50 mg/dL: immediate dextrose bolus (D10, 2 mL/kg)


### Neonatal Assessment in the Field

- **ABC:** Airway is not just A—consider positioning, suction, and BVM for apnea
- **Thermoregulation:** Dry, warm, skin-to-skin, warm packs immediately
- **Glucose:** Check at arrival, after correction, and with every change
- **Perfusion:** Cap refill, pulses, color; hypotension means late/critical shock
- **History:** Birth history, gestational age, maternal infection/drugs, feeding

***

## Common Mistakes

- Relying on oxygen alone for cyanosis—cardiac causes may not respond
- Delaying glucose correction while looking for IV access—consider IO and oral/NG
- Underestimating sepsis; normal temp may mask infection
- Overventilating or under-ventilating with BVM/intubation (volume control is critical)
- Not keeping neonate warm—hypothermia is a rapid killer

***

## Clinical Pearls

- **If unexplained cyanosis + respiratory distress, consider congenital heart: Prostaglandin E₁, unless contraindicated.**
- **Never use high-flow O₂ alone for central cyanosis; check pre/post-ductal sats and reassess.**
- **A neonate “not feeding,” “weak,” or “off color” is sick until proven well.**
- **Hypoglycemia must be corrected immediately; every minute worsens neuro outcome.**
- **Thermoregulation (keep baby warm!) is as important as airway, breathing, and glucose.**

***

## Decision Trees

**Neonatal Field Algorithm**

1. **Airway and Breathing**
    - If apneic or severe distress: Position, clear airway, BVM with <30 cmH₂O, intubate if persistent
2. **Circulation**
    - Delayed cap refill? Cool? Weak pulses? Begin fluid bolus (10 mL/kg NS, carefully titrated)
3. **Oxygen and Color**
    - Central cyanosis unresponsive to O₂: Suspect ductal-dependent lesion, start Prost E₁
4. **Glucose**
    - <45 mg/dL: D10, 2 mL/kg IV/IO, repeat as needed
5. **Temp**
    - Hypothermic: Dry, warm, minimize exposure

***

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: Silent Blue Baby

- 5-day-old, poor feeding, cyanotic, O₂ sat 72% on NRB
- Timeline: 0min—arrival, 4min—no response to O₂, 8min—murmur heard
> What’s your next critical intervention?


### Case 2: Septic Collapse

- 2-week-old, pale, weak cry, rectal temp 35.2°C, low tone
- Timeline: 0min—PEDS found, 5min—BGL 39, 10min—bolus given, status improves
> What’s your field plan and handoff priorities?


### Case 3: Respiratory Distress

- 4-day-old, nasal flaring, chest retractions, RR 80
- Timeline: 0min—scene, 6min—mild grunting, 10min—sats drop, cap refill 4s
> Interventions and transport escalation?


### Case 4: Hypoglycemic Seizure

- 1-week-old, jerking, BGL 26, not responding
- Timeline: 0min—911 call, 2min—dextrose bolus, 8min—repeat seizure
> What do you check, what’s your next move?


### Case 5: Heart Failure

- 10-day-old, tachypneic, sweats with feeds, poor weight gain
- Timeline: 0min—arrival, 3min—Sats 78%, chest X-ray: cardiomegaly
> Right field steps?


### Case 6: Cold Stress

- 3-day-old, home birth, found floppy, temp 33.1°C

## Reflection Placeholder

**Structured Reflection Questions:**

- What signs in a neonate make you worry most, even if the family says “they’re usually like this”?
- How do you prioritize your ABC steps when the baby is simultaneously cold, hypoglycemic, and not breathing?

# Obstetric Emergencies

**Level:** Advanced
**Topic:** OB · EMS/Critical Care
**Duration:** Deep Dive

***

## Arrival Scenario

You’re called for a 28F, 35 weeks, severe abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding. She’s pale, tachycardic, hypotensive, and doubled over.
You know OB emergencies can spiral fast. The question: is this preterm labor, placental abruption, uterine rupture, or something even more dangerous for both patients?

***

## Warm-Up Questions

1. What’s the first bedside sign of maternal shock?
2. Which OB emergencies require immediate transport, not delivery?
3. What must you always check for in active third trimester bleeding?
4. How can you identify (and avoid causing) uterine rupture or cord prolapse?
5. Why is left lateral positioning critical in OB trauma/code scenarios?

## Explanation / Breakdown

### OB Crisis Patterns

- **Hemorrhage (Placental abruption, previa, rupture):**
    - Severe pain, vaginal bleeding, rigid/tender uterus, fetal distress
- **Eclampsia/Pre-eclampsia:**
    - HTN, headache, visual change, RUQ pain, seizures (stats: BP >140/90, proteinuria)
    - Magnesium sulfate mainstay, antihypertensive for severe crisis
- **Cord prolapse:**
    - Sudden fetal bradycardia, visible/palpable cord, presentation before head
    - Immediate knee-chest positioning, manual cord elevation
- **Preterm labor:**
    - Uterine contractions, cervical change, rupture of membranes, <37wks
    - Tocolytics only if permitted, rapid OB evaluation
- **Trauma:**
    - Maternal > fetal priorities; uterine rupture, placental injury, abruption

***

## Common Mistakes

- Delaying transport to “deliver” in unstable hemorrhage—rapid OB center transfer is safest
- Missing eclampsia warning signs; BP/vision changes can occur before seizure
- Misidentifying abnormal presentation (breech, shoulder) in out-of-hospital birth
- Under-appreciating maternal shock; fetus is at risk even when vitals seem “high normal”

***

## Clinical Pearls

- **Maternal hypotension = fetal injury until proven otherwise.**
- Ask about number and timing of pregnancies/deliveries—high parity = higher rupture risk
- Re-check BP every five minutes in suspected eclampsia or preeclampsia
- Magnesium is first-line for seizure prevention/treatment in eclampsia unless contraindicated
- Fundal height can help estimate gestation fast (pubic = 12wks, umbilicus = 20-24wks, xyphoid = 36wks)

***

## Decision Trees

**OB Emergency Algorithm**

1. **Hemodynamic instability/bleeding?**
    - Yes → Left lateral, O₂, IV, rapid OB transport, monitor for shock
2. **Seizure or neuro changes?**
    - Yes → Magnesium sulfate (protocol), secure airway, prep antihypertensives
3. **Cord prolapse?**
    - Yes → Cord elevation (gloved finger), knee-chest or Trendelenburg, O₂, rapid transport
4. **Premature ruptured membranes/labor?**
    - Yes → Monitor fetal/maternal, minimize contractions, prepare for precipitous delivery
5. **Trauma?**
    - Triage maternal > fetal, full trauma assessment, rapid OB notification

***

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: Pain + Bleeding Third Trimester

- 32F, 37 wks, bright red vaginal bleed, tender uterus, no contractions.
- Timeline: 0min—arrival, 8min—BP 82/44, HR 130, O₂ 98%
> What’s your move to protect both patients?


### Case 2: Hypertensive Crisis

- 25F, 30 wks, blurred vision, RUQ pain, BP 186/104.
- Timeline: 0min—found seated, 12min—headache worsens, 15min—seizure
> Which meds, what lines, and which complications to expect?


### Case 3: Cord Prolapse

- 28F, 38 wks, sudden urge to push, cord visible at introitus.
- Timeline: 0min—found on bathroom, 2min—bradycardia developing
> What’s your manual and positioning priority?


### Case 4: Trauma and OB

- 31F, 20wks, MVA, mild pain, seatbelt injury across lower abdomen.
- Timeline: 0min—extrication, 15min—worsening abdominal pain

### Case 5: Out-of-Hospital Delivery, Breech

- 22F, active labor, feet/buttock presenting, toes visible, contractions 2min apart.
- Timeline: 0min—EMS, 8min—crowning

# Pediatrics Emergencies

**Level:** Advanced
**Topic:** Pediatric Critical Care · EMS · Flight
**Duration:** Deep Dive

***

## Arrival Scenario

You’re dispatched for a seizing 3-year-old, history “recent viral illness.” On scene: GCS 8, tonic-clonic activity, BG 62, O₂ sat 94%. Parents are panicked.
What’s your stepwise approach that maximizes survival and neuro outcome? Are you ready for respiratory arrest—or is something more subtle the true threat?

***

## Warm-Up Questions

1. When is a febrile seizure “routine,” and when is it a red flag?
2. Name two physical findings that force you to move fast in pediatric respiratory distress.
3. Which metabolic derangements present with “not acting right” rather than vital sign change?
4. What’s your painless “age-based” airway cue for a pediatric vs. adult tube?
5. Why is early IV/IO access higher priority in peds than adults?

***

## Optional Tally Embed

*Insert Tally quiz placeholder here.*

***

## Explanation / Breakdown

### Pediatric Field Priorities

- **Airway:** Prefer non-invasive, jaw lift/chin position; avoid cricoid pressure
- **Breathing:** Monitor for fatigue, head bob, nasal flaring, “see-saw” breathing
- **Circulation:** Capillary refill >2s, pulse weak, delayed; BP drop is late
- **Disability:** AVPU (Alert, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive), pupils, glucose, fontanel
- **Exposure/Environment:** Look for bruises, rashes, petechiae, infections; keep warm


### Most Common \& Lethal Pediatric Emergencies

- **Status epilepticus:** Seizures >5 min OR recurring with incomplete recovery
    - Benzos first, beware hypoglycemia, airway at risk
- **Respiratory failure/distress:**
    - Asthma, bronchiolitis, croup, pneumonia, foreign body
    - Fatigue = near arrest; intubate early only if non-invasive fails
- **Shock (hypovolemic/septic/cardiogenic):**
    - Tachycardia, weak pulses, confusion, cool skin; hypotension is a pre-arrest late sign
- **Metabolic (DKA, endocrinopathy, inborn error):**
    - Hyper/hypoglycemia, sodium disturbances, new neurologic findings
- **Trauma (see trauma module):**
    - Abdominal > head > chest

***

## Common Mistakes

- Delaying benzos/labs for seizures >5 min (status).
- Not monitoring for apnea/airway obstruction after status or during transport.
- Ignoring the “fatiguing” child in respiratory crisis—child who slows is about to arrest.
- Failing to check glucose for “not acting right.”
- Underestimating decompensation speed (vitals may be “normal” until the collapse).

***

## Clinical Pearls

- **Any child with slow capillary refill is shock until proven well—act fast.**
- **“Normal” BP does not reassure you; pulse, mental status, and extremity warmth matter more.**
- **Go IO if you cannot get IV access in 90 seconds; never wait.**
- **In febrile seizure, “worst” are those with status, underlying neuro, or new focal deficits.**
- **Always weigh child or use length-based resuscitation tape—no guessing doses.**

***

## Decision Trees

**Pediatric Emergency Algorithm**

1. **Airway/Breathing distress or seizure?**
    - Yes → Position, suction, non-invasive support, benzos (if seizure)
2. **Shock (cap refill >2s, altered, pale, cold):**
    - Yes → 20 mL/kg bolus NS, rapid reassessment, repeat once (max 60 mL/kg pre-transfer), escalate if no improvement
3. **Glucose <70 or >250?**
    - Yes → Treat per protocol; D10 in infants, D25 in older kids
4. **Unknown/unclear cause?**
    - AVPU, exposure, full reassessment, soonest facility for full workup

***

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: Febrile Status

- 3M, 39.9°C, seizure >10min, BG 110, O₂ sat 97%
- Timeline: 0min—seizure, 6min—benzo, 12min—no return to baseline
> Field pathway? Next escalation?


### Case 2: Near Respiratory Arrest

- 6F, asthma, tripod, O₂ 88%, RR 48, silent chest.
- Timeline: 0min—arrival, 3min—albuterol, 7min—no change, fatigue
> What signals you to intubate? Preparations?


### Case 3: Sepsis/Unknown Shock

- 2F, fever, pale, lethargic, cap refill 5s.
- Timeline: 0min—found, 6min—IV, 10min—bolus/ABX, BP 72/40
> Early clues, and why is hypotension so late?


### Case 4: Metabolic DKA

- 11M, polyuria, vomiting, rapid breathing, fruity breath.
- Timeline: 0min—scene, 10min—IV, 14min—glucose 522, ketones high
> When do you give fluids? Insulin? What are your field limits?


### Case 5: Simple vs. Complex Seizure

- 9F, h/o epilepsy, single 2-min seizure, fully recovers.
- Timeline: 0min—call, 10min—normal
> Transport, discharge, or something else?
