# Blood Administration

**Level:** Advanced  
**Topic:** Critical Care / Trauma  
**Duration:** 75 minutes

---

## Arrival Scenario

You're transporting a 42-year-old male from a rural ED to a trauma center. GSW to abdomen, emergent ex-lap, lost 2 liters in the OR. He's hypotensive (BP 82/50), tachy (HR 135), pale, and cold.

The surgeon hands you 4 units of PRBCs and 2 units of FFP. "He needs these on the way. Massive transfusion protocol. You good?"

You better be.

**Because when you're moving blood, mistakes kill fast.**

---

## Warm-Up Questions

Before we get into protocols, answer these:

1. **What's the maximum hang time for a unit of blood?**
2. **Can you run blood through the same line as normal saline?**
3. **What happens if you give

 ABO-incompatible blood?**
4. **What's the difference between PRBCs, FFP, and platelets?**
5. **What are the signs of a transfusion reaction?**

Think through it. These aren't theoretical—they're life-or-death.

## Explanation / Breakdown

### Blood Product Basics

#### Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBCs)
- **What it is:** RBCs with most plasma removed
- **What it does:** Carries oxygen, increases Hgb
- **Volume:** ~300 mL per unit
- **Raises Hgb by:** ~1 g/dL per unit
- **When to use:** Hemorrhage, severe anemia (Hgb < 7), symptomatic anemia

#### Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)
- **What it is:** Liquid portion of blood with clotting factors
- **What it does:** Replaces clotting factors, corrects coagulopathy
- **Volume:** ~250 mL per unit
- **When to use:** Massive transfusion, warfarin reversal, coagulopathy, DIC

#### Platelets
- **What it is:** Concentrated platelets from multiple donors
- **What it does:** Stops bleeding, helps clotting
- **Volume:** ~300 mL per unit
- **When to use:** Thrombocytopenia (< 50K in bleeding patient), platelet dysfunction

#### Cryoprecipitate ("Cryo")
- **What it is:** Concentrated fibrinogen, factor VIII, vWF
- **What it does:** Provides fibrinogen for clot formation
- **When to use:** Hypofibrinogenemia, massive transfusion, DIC

### Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP)

In massive hemorrhage, you don't transfuse one product at a time. You give **balanced resuscitation**:

**1:1:1 Ratio**  
- 1 unit PRBCs : 1 unit FFP : 1 unit Platelets (per 6-pack)

**Why?** Giving only PRBCs dilutes clotting factors and causes coagulopathy. Balanced resuscitation prevents this.

**Activation criteria:**
- Loss of 1 blood volume in 24 hours
- 50% blood volume in 3 hours
- > 4 units PRBCs in 1 hour
- Shock + ongoing bleeding

### Blood Compatibility

#### ABO Compatibility Chart

| Recipient | Can Receive | Universal? |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| O- | O- only | Universal Donor |
| O+ | O-, O+ | — |
| A- | O-, A- | — |
| A+ | O-, O+, A-, A+ | — |
| B- | O-, B- | — |
| B+ | O-, O+, B-, B+ | — |
| AB- | O-, A-, B-, AB- | — |
| AB+ | All types | Universal Recipient |

**In emergencies:**  
- Use O- PRBCs (universal donor)
- Use AB plasma (universal donor for plasma)

**Type-specific is better than O- when available.** O- is precious—save it for true unknowns.

### Administration Rules

**1. Verify blood product TWICE**
- Check patient name, DOB, blood type
- Check unit number, expiration, integrity
- Two providers confirm (you + nurse/medic)

**2. Use proper tubing**
- Blood administration set with 170-micron filter
- **NEVER** use a standard IV set

**3. Compatible fluids**
- Normal saline ONLY
- No LR (calcium binds citrate in blood)
- No D5W (causes hemolysis)

**4. Warming**
- Use a blood warmer for rapid transfusion
- Prevents hypothermia-induced coagulopathy
- **NEVER** microwave or use hot water

**5. Hang time**
- Maximum 4 hours per unit
- After 4 hours, blood must be discarded
- Start a new unit if not infused

**6. Rate**
- Trauma/hemorrhage: **wide open** (pressure bag, rapid infuser)
- Stable patient: 2-4 hours per unit
- Watch for volume overload in cardiac/renal patients

### Transfusion Reactions

#### Acute Hemolytic Reaction (ABO incompatibility)
**Timing:** Immediate (within minutes)  
**Signs:** Fever, chills, back/chest pain, hypotension, dark urine, shock  
**Action:** STOP transfusion immediately, maintain IV with NS, treat shock, notify blood bank

#### Febrile Non-Hemolytic Reaction
**Timing:** Within hours  
**Signs:** Fever (> 1°C rise), chills, mild discomfort  
**Action:** Slow/stop transfusion, give acetaminophen, monitor closely

#### Allergic Reaction
**Timing:** Minutes to hours  
**Signs:** Urticaria (hives), itching, flushing, mild respiratory symptoms  
**Action:** Stop transfusion, give Benadryl (diphenhydramine), may resume if mild

#### Anaphylaxis
**Timing:** Immediate  
**Signs:** Severe respiratory distress, angioedema, hypotension, shock  
**Action:** Stop transfusion, epi 0.3-0.5 mg IM, aggressive airway management, IV fluids

#### TRALI (Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury)
**Timing:** Within 6 hours  
**Signs:** Acute respiratory distress, hypoxia, bilateral infiltrates, no fluid overload  
**Action:** Stop transfusion, supportive care (O2, CPAP, intubation if needed)

#### TACO (Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload)
**Timing:** During or shortly after  
**Signs:** Dyspnea, hypertension, JVD, crackles, pulmonary edema  
**Action:** Stop/slow transfusion, sit patient upright, diuretics, O2, CPAP

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Using the Wrong IV Line
Blood + D5W = hemolysis. Blood + calcium-containing fluids = clotting. Use NS only.

### Mistake #2: Skipping the Double-Check
Giving incompatible blood is catastrophic. Always verify twice with two people.

### Mistake #3: Running Blood Too Slow in Hemorrhage
In massive bleeding, RUN IT WIDE OPEN. Use a pressure bag. Seconds matter.

### Mistake #4: Ignoring Early Transfusion Reactions
Fever, chills, back pain in the first 15 minutes? STOP THE BLOOD. Don't wait.

### Mistake #5: Forgetting to Warm
Cold blood causes hypothermia → coagulopathy → more bleeding. Always use a warmer.

### Mistake #6: Over-Transfusing Stable Patients
Not everyone needs a Hgb of 10. Restrictive strategy (Hgb 7-8) is often better.

## Clinical Pearls

💎 **O- PRBCs are liquid gold.** Use type-specific when possible. Save O- for unknowns.

💎 **1:1:1 saves lives.** In massive transfusion, balanced resuscitation prevents coagulopathy.

💎 **Check within 15 minutes.** Most acute reactions happen early. Stay at bedside.

💎 **Hypothermia kills.** Warm the blood, warm the patient. The lethal triad (hypothermia, acidosis, coagulopathy) is real.

💎 **Back pain during transfusion = hemolytic reaction until proven otherwise.** Stop immediately.

💎 **Platelets don't work if patient is cold.** Warm first, then transfuse.

💎 **AB plasma is universal donor plasma.** In emergency MTP, use AB plasma if type-specific unavailable.

💎 **Document everything.** Unit numbers, times, vitals, reactions. Medicolegal and quality control.

💎 **When in doubt, STOP.** You can always restart. You can't undo a fatal reaction.

```

### Transfusion Reaction Response

```
Reaction Suspected
    ↓
STOP TRANSFUSION IMMEDIATELY
    ↓
Maintain IV access with NS (new line if possible)
    ↓
Check vitals
    ↓
Assess type of reaction:

Fever + back pain + hypotension?
    → HEMOLYTIC REACTION
    → Aggressive fluid resuscitation
    → Treat shock
    → Send blood sample + urine sample
    → Notify blood bank STAT

Respiratory distress + hypoxia?
    → TRALI or TACO?
    → TRALI: bilateral infiltrates, no JVD → Supportive care, O2
    → TACO: hypertension, JVD, crackles → Diuretics, CPAP

Hives + itching?
    → ALLERGIC REACTION
    → Benadryl 25-50 mg IV/IM
    → Monitor airway
    → Mild? May resume transfusion slowly

Severe respiratory distress + angioedema?
    → ANAPHYLAXIS
    → Epi 0.3-0.5 mg IM
    → Airway management
    → Aggressive treatment

Fever only, no other symptoms?
    → FEBRILE NON-HEMOLYTIC
    → Acetaminophen
    → Monitor closely
    → May resume if mild
```

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: The Trauma Patient

**Patient:** 28-year-old male, MVC, ruptured spleen, in OR for 2 hours  
**Status:** BP 78/40, HR 142, cold/clammy, 6 units PRBCs given so far  
**Lab:** Hgb 5.2, INR 2.1, platelets 45K  

**What blood products do you anticipate needing?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Continued balanced MTP: PRBCs, FFP, Platelets (1:1:1 ratio)

**Why:**  
- Ongoing hemorrhage with shock
- Coagulopathy developing (INR elevated, platelets dropping)
- Needs balanced resuscitation to prevent "dilutional coagulopathy"

**Action:**  
- Activate MTP if not already done
- Prepare 4 more units PRBCs, 4 FFP, 1 platelet pack
- Consider TXA if < 3 hours from injury
- Keep patient warm (blood warmer, Bair Hugger)
- Massive transfuser if available

</details>

---

### Case 2: The Reaction

**Patient:** 65-year-old female, GI bleed, receiving 2nd unit of PRBCs  
**Event:** 20 minutes into transfusion, patient reports severe back pain, fever 101.8°F, BP dropping to 88/52

**What's happening and what do you do?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction

**Why:**  
- Back pain + fever + hypotension during transfusion = classic triad
- Suggests ABO incompatibility (wrong blood type given)

**Action:**  
- STOP transfusion IMMEDIATELY
- Disconnect blood tubing (do NOT flush line)
- Start new IV with NS, run wide open
- Treat hypotension (fluids, pressors if needed)
- Save the blood unit and tubing (send back to blood bank)
- Draw blood sample (hemolysis labs: bili, haptoglobin, LDH)
- Catch urine sample (check for hemoglobinuria)
- Notify blood bank and physician STAT
- Prepare for DIC, renal failure

</details>

---

### Case 3: The CHF Patient

**Patient:** 80-year-old female, CHF (EF 25%), symptomatic anemia  
**Lab:** Hgb 6.8  
**Orders:** Transfuse 2 units PRBCs

**What's your concern?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Risk of TACO (volume overload)

**Why:**  
- CHF patients have poor cardiac reserve
- Each unit = 300 mL of volume
- High risk of pulmonary edema

**Action:**  
- Transfuse slowly (2-4 hours per unit minimum)
- Pre-medicate with diuretic (Lasix 20-40 mg IV) if ordered
- Monitor closely: vitals q15 min, lung sounds
- Watch for: increased work of breathing, crackles, hypoxia, hypertension
- Keep head of bed elevated
- Stop immediately if signs of overload

</details>

---

### Case 4: The Unstable Type

**Patient:** 34-year-old male, stab wound to chest, hypotensive, type unknown  
**Surgeon:** "He needs blood NOW. We don't have time to type him."

**What do you give?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** O- PRBCs and AB plasma (universal donors)

**Why:**  
- O- blood has no A or B antigens (won't react with any antibodies)
- AB plasma has no anti-A or anti-B antibodies (won't attack patient cells)
- This is the safest emergency combination

**Action:**  
- Give O- PRBCs immediately (pressure bag, wide open)
- Give AB plasma (or type-specific if known soon)
- Send type and cross NOW (results in 30-45 min)
- Switch to type-specific as soon as available
- Document "emergency release" protocol used

</details>

---

### Case 5: The Delayed Reaction

**Patient:** 52-year-old male, received 2 units PRBCs yesterday for GI bleed  
**Now:** Fever 100.9°F, mild SOB, urticaria on trunk

**What is this?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Delayed allergic/febrile transfusion reaction

**Why:**  
- Occurred hours after transfusion (not immediate)
- Fever + urticaria suggests immune response
- Could be febrile non-hemolytic or delayed allergic reaction

**Action:**  
- Benadryl 25-50 mg PO/IV
- Acetaminophen 650 mg PO
- Monitor respiratory status (TRALI can occur up to 6 hours post-transfusion)
- If worsens: O2, consider steroids
- Document and report to blood bank
- Patient may need pre-meds (Benadryl, Tylenol) before future transfusions

## Reflection

You just learned how to safely administer blood products in high-stakes situations.

Here's what you should know cold:

✅ Blood product types and indications  
✅ Massive transfusion protocol (1:1:1 ratio)  
✅ ABO compatibility and universal donors  
✅ Administration rules (verification, tubing, fluids, warming)  
✅ Transfusion reactions (recognition and response)  
✅ When to STOP and how to intervene  

**Next-level thinking:**
- How do you manage Jehovah's Witness patients who refuse blood?
- What's the role of whole blood in trauma resuscitation?
- How does hypothermia affect transfusion efficacy?
- When should you consider factor concentrates vs FFP?

**Your assignment:**  
Shadow a blood transfusion from start to finish. Observe the checks, the monitoring, the documentation. Ask questions. This is high-risk, high-reward medicine—learn it right.

Because when you're the only thing between your patient and exsanguination, you better know what you're doing.
