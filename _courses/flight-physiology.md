# Flight Physiology

**Level:** Advanced  
**Topic:** Flight / Critical Care Transport  
**Duration:** 50 minutes

## Arrival Scenario

You're lifting off with a head injury patient at 2,000 ft MSL. Your pilot announces, "Climbing to 8,500 feet for smoother air."

Your patient's Glasgow Coma Scale was 12 on the ground. Five minutes into the climb, he's now a 9. His SpO2 dropped from 97% to 91%. The chest tube you placed is bubbling more aggressively.

**Altitude is doing things to your patient. And you need to understand why.**

## Warm-Up Questions

Before we get into the physiology, answer these:

1. **What is the atmospheric pressure at sea level? At 18,000 feet?**
2. **What happens to gas volume as altitude increases?**
3. **What's the relationship between altitude and oxygen availability?**
4. **Why does hypoxia worsen faster at altitude?**
5. **At what altitude does cabin pressure in a pressurized aircraft typically equate to?**

These aren't trivia questions. They're the foundation of safe flight medicine.

## Explanation / Breakdown

### Atmospheric Pressure and Altitude

**Sea Level:**
- Atmospheric pressure: 760 mmHg (14.7 psi)
- FiO2: 21% (159 mmHg partial pressure of O2)

**As altitude increases:**
- Atmospheric pressure DECREASES
- Partial pressure of O2 DECREASES (even though FiO2 stays 21%)
- Gas volumes EXPAND

| Altitude (ft) | Atmospheric Pressure | Equivalent Cabin Pressure |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| 0 (Sea Level) | 760 mmHg | N/A |
| 5,000 | 632 mmHg | Typical pressurized cabin |
| 8,000 | 564 mmHg | Max FAA pressurized cabin |
| 10,000 | 523 mmHg | Supplemental O2 recommended |
| 18,000 | 380 mmHg | 50% gas expansion |
| 34,000 | 179 mmHg | Commercial jet cruise altitude |

**Pressurized vs. Unpressurized Aircraft:**
- **Pressurized:** Cabin altitude typically 5,000-8,000 ft (regardless of actual altitude)
- **Unpressurized:** Cabin altitude = actual altitude

### The Gas Laws (Applied to Flight Medicine)

#### Boyle's Law
**"As pressure decreases, volume increases"**

**Formula:** P₁V₁ = P₂V₂

**Clinical Application:**
- **Pneumothorax:** Small PTX on ground → tension PTX at altitude
- **Pneumocephalus:** Air pockets in skull expand → increased ICP
- **Bowel obstruction:** Gas-filled loops expand → perforation risk
- **Air splints:** Over-inflate at altitude → compartment syndrome
- **ETT cuff:** Over-inflates at altitude → tracheal ischemia
- **MAST/PASG:** Can over-inflate
- **IV bags:** Expand and may burst

**Example:**
At sea level: 100 mL pneumothorax  
At 8,000 ft: 136 mL pneumothorax  
At 18,000 ft: 200 mL pneumothorax

**What to do:**
- Chest tube ALL pneumothoraces before flight (even small ones)
- Check ETT cuff pressure at altitude (use manometer)
- Deflate air splints and use rigid splints
- Vent IV bags
- Avoid flying with bowel obstruction if possible

#### Dalton's Law
**"Total pressure = sum of partial pressures of gases"**

**Clinical Application:**
- As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases
- Partial pressure of O2 decreases (even though % stays 21%)
- Less O2 available for gas exchange

**Sea Level:**  
PO2 = 0.21 x 760 mmHg = 159 mmHg

**At 10,000 ft:**  
PO2 = 0.21 x 523 mmHg = 110 mmHg

**Result:** Hypoxemia worsens at altitude

**What to do:**
- Increase FiO2 at altitude (to maintain same PaO2)
- Baseline hypoxic patients (COPD, pneumonia) will decompensate faster
- Monitor SpO2 closely during ascent

#### Henry's Law
**"Gas solubility in liquid is proportional to pressure"**

**Clinical Application:**
- Decreased pressure → dissolved gases come out of solution
- **Decompression sickness ("the bends"):**
  - Nitrogen bubbles form in blood/tissues
  - Occurs in divers ascending too fast OR rapid ascent to altitude after diving

**What to do:**
- Wait 24 hours after scuba diving before flying
- If DCS suspected: descend, high-flow O2, transport to hyperbaric facility

#### Graham's Law
**"Rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to molecular weight"**

**Clinical Application:**
- Lighter gases (O2, N2) diffuse faster than heavier gases (CO2)
- At altitude, hypoxia develops faster than hypercarbia

### The Stressors of Flight

#### Hypoxia
**Cause:** Decreased partial pressure of O2 at altitude

**Types:**
1. **Hypoxic hypoxia:** Not enough O2 (altitude)
2. **Hypemic hypoxia:** Not enough Hgb (anemia, CO poisoning)
3. **Stagnant hypoxia:** Poor circulation (shock, CHF)
4. **Histotoxic hypoxia:** Cells can't use O2 (cyanide poisoning)

**Symptoms (Time of Useful Consciousness):**

| Altitude | TUC | Symptoms |
|----------|-----|----------|
| 18,000 ft | 20-30 min | Impaired judgment, euphoria |
| 25,000 ft | 3-5 min | Confusion, cyanosis, loss of consciousness |
| 30,000 ft | 1-2 min | Rapid unconsciousness |
| 40,000 ft | 15-20 sec | Immediate unconsciousness |

**Prevention:**
- Supplemental O2 for all patients
- Crew O2 above 10,000 ft
- Pulse oximetry monitoring
- Recognize early signs (headache, fatigue, poor judgment)

#### Thermal Stress
**Temperature decreases ~2°C per 1,000 ft**

**Problems:**
- **Hypothermia:** Trauma patients, neonates, burns
- **Cold stress:** Increases O2 consumption

**Prevention:**
- Warm cabin
- Blankets, Bair Hugger
- Warm IV fluids
- Monitor temperature

#### Vibration and Noise
**Effects:**
- Fatigue
- Difficulty hearing (alarms, breath sounds, BP)
- Increased O2 consumption
- Motion sickness

**Prevention:**
- Hearing protection
- Use pulse ox instead of auscultation
- Visual monitoring of equipment
- Secure all equipment

#### Decreased Humidity
**Cabin humidity often < 10%**

**Problems:**
- Dehydration
- Thickened secretions
- ETT obstruction
- Corneal drying (in sedated patients)

**Prevention:**
- IV fluids
- Humidified O2 if available
- Lubricate eyes in sedated/paralyzed patients
- Suction PRN

#### G-Forces (Acceleration/Deceleration)
**Forward acceleration:** Blood pools posteriorly  
**Backward deceleration:** Blood pools anteriorly  
**Turns:** Lateral G-forces

**Problems:**
- Hypotension
- Increased ICP (in head-up position during acceleration)
- Equipment displacement
- Patient discomfort

**Prevention:**
- Secure patient firmly
- Anticipate turns/turbulence
- Position patient feet-first (when possible)

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Not Chest Tubing Small Pneumothoraces
"It's only 10%, we'll watch it." At 8,000 ft, that 10% becomes 15%. Tube it.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring ETT Cuff Pressure
Cuff over-inflates at altitude → tracheal necrosis. Check pressure, adjust as needed.

### Mistake #3: Assuming Pulse Ox Is Accurate Without Supplemental O2
Altitude drops PaO2. Your hypoxic patient will get worse. Don't rely on "ground" oxygen saturations.

### Mistake #4: Using Air Splints
They over-inflate at altitude. Use rigid splints.

### Mistake #5: Flying Too Soon After Scuba Diving
Decompression sickness risk. Wait 24 hours post-dive.

### Mistake #6: Not Increasing FiO2 Prophylactically
Don't wait for desaturation. Increase O2 before/during ascent.

## Clinical Pearls

💎 **Gas expands 30% at 8,000 ft, 100% at 18,000 ft.** Every air-filled cavity is affected.

💎 **All pneumothoraces get chest tubes before flight.** Even small ones. No exceptions.

💎 **ETT cuff pressure should be checked at altitude.** Use a manometer. Adjust PRN.

💎 **Hypoxia is insidious at altitude.** Your judgment deteriorates before you realize it. Monitor yourself and your crew.

💎 **Pulse ox lags behind true hypoxia.** By the time SpO2 drops, PaO2 has already dropped significantly.

💎 **Head injury patients do worse at altitude.** Pneumocephalus expands → increased ICP. Fly as low as safely possible.

💎 **Neonates and pediatric patients decompensate faster.** Higher metabolic rate, less reserve.

💎 **Cabin noise makes auscultation useless.** Use pulse ox, capnography, visual assessment.

💎 **The sicker the patient, the lower you should fly.** Work with your pilot to balance safety and physiology.

💎 **Prophylactic antiemetics for everyone.** Motion sickness is common, vomiting with a secured airway is dangerous.

## Decision Trees

### Pre-Flight Patient Assessment

```
Patient Requires Air Transport
    ↓
ASSESS FOR CONTRAINDICATIONS
    ↓
Pneumothorax present?
    YES → Chest tube placed?
        NO → PLACE CHEST TUBE before flight
        YES → Continue assessment
    NO → Continue assessment
    ↓
Bowel obstruction or ileus?
    YES → Consider ground transport (gas expansion risk)
    ↓
Recent scuba diving (< 24 hours)?
    YES → Risk of DCS → delay flight or accept risk
    ↓
Severe respiratory distress despite max therapy?
    YES → Consider ECMO transport or ground

READY FOR FLIGHT
```

### In-Flight Deterioration

```
Patient Deteriorating at Altitude
    ↓
Identify Problem
    ↓
Hypoxia (SpO2 dropping)?
    → Increase FiO2 to 100%
    → Check ventilator settings (increase rate/TV if needed)
    → Request lower altitude from pilot
    → Rule out PTX (listen, look for subcutaneous emphysema)
    ↓
Increased ICP (GCS dropping, posturing)?
    → Head injury + altitude = pneumocephalus expansion
    → Request lower altitude
    → Hyperventilate (PaCO2 30-35)
    → Elevate head of stretcher
    → Osmotic therapy (mannitol 0.25-1 g/kg or 3% saline)
    ↓
Hypotension?
    → Rule out tension PTX (needle decompress if present)
    → IV fluid bolus
    → Vasopressors if needed
    → Check for bleeding
    → Request lower altitude
    ↓
Chest tube bubbling excessively?
    → PTX expanding at altitude (expected)
    → Ensure chest tube patent
    → Request lower altitude if respiratory distress
    → May need second chest tube
    ↓
ETT cuff leak?
    → Cuff over-expanded and burst OR under-filled
    → Check cuff pressure
    → Adjust inflation
    → May need to reintubate
    ↓
Equipment malfunction?
    → Switch to backup (have backups ready)
    → Manual ventilation if needed
    → Request lower altitude or landing if critical
```

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: The Head Injury

**Patient:** 28-year-old male, MVC, GCS 10 (E2V3M5), intubated  
**CT:** Small pneumocephalus, no surgical lesion  
**Flight Plan:** 45-minute flight, cruise altitude 8,000 ft  
**10 minutes into flight:** GCS now 7 (E1V1M5), pupils sluggish

**What's happening and what do you do?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Pneumocephalus expansion at altitude causing increased ICP

**Why:**
- Air in skull expands as pressure decreases (Boyle's Law)
- At 8,000 ft, gas volume increases ~30%
- Small pneumocephalus on ground → larger at altitude
- Increased ICP → decreased GCS

**Action:**
1. **Request immediate descent** (lower altitude = lower gas volume)
2. **Hyperventilate** (PaCO2 30-35 to reduce ICP)
3. **Elevate head of bed 30°**
4. **Osmotic therapy:**
   - Mannitol 0.25-1 g/kg IV over 20 min OR
   - 3% saline 250 mL bolus
5. **Ensure adequate sedation** (prevents agitation → increased ICP)
6. **Notify receiving facility** (may need emergent surgery)

**Prevention:**
- Fly as low as safely possible with head injuries
- Consider ground transport if significant pneumocephalus
- Prophylactic hyperventilation during ascent

### Case 2: The Respiratory Patient

**Patient:** 68-year-old male, COPD exacerbation, SpO2 91% on 4L NC at sea level  
**Flight Plan:** 30-minute flight, unpressurized aircraft, cruise altitude 10,000 ft  
**During ascent:** SpO2 drops to 78% despite increasing O2 to 6L NC

**Why is he desaturating?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Decreased partial pressure of oxygen at altitude (Dalton's Law)

**Why:**
- At 10,000 ft, atmospheric pressure is 523 mmHg (vs. 760 at sea level)
- Partial pressure of O2 decreases proportionally
- Even with supplemental O2, effective PaO2 is lower
- Patient with baseline hypoxemia (COPD) decompensates quickly

**Action:**
1. **Increase FiO2 to 100%** (NRB mask or high-flow if available)
2. **Request lower altitude** (descend to improve PaO2)
3. **Consider BiPAP** (if available and patient tolerates)
4. **Monitor closely** (may need intubation)
5. **Reassess at lower altitude**

**Prevention:**
- Baseline hypoxic patients should fly on higher O2 from the start
- Consider flying lower (or ground transport)
- Intubate before flight if marginal respiratory status

**Pearl:** Rule of thumb: Increase FiO2 by ~3-5% for every 1,000 ft of altitude in hypoxic patients.

</details>

### Case 3: The Chest Trauma

**Patient:** 42-year-old male, stab wound to left chest, small pneumothorax (15%) on CXR, stable  
**Sending facility:** "It's small, we'll watch it during transport."  
**Flight Plan:** 60-minute flight, cabin altitude 8,000 ft

**Should you fly without a chest tube?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** NO. Place a chest tube before flight.

**Why:**
- Small PTX (15%) at sea level → 20% at 8,000 ft (30% expansion)
- Can become tension PTX at altitude
- Symptoms:
  - Increased respiratory distress
  - Hypoxia
  - Hypotension
  - Tracheal deviation
- Needle decompression in flight is difficult and dangerous
- If you tube it on the ground, it's controlled

**Action:**
1. **Refuse flight until chest tube placed**
2. If sending facility refuses:
   - Document refusal
   - Request lower altitude (or ground transport)
   - Have needle decompression kit ready
3. If chest tube placed:
   - Ensure functioning properly
   - Attach to drainage system
   - Expect increased bubbling at altitude (normal)
   - Secure tube well (vibration can dislodge)

**Absolute rule in flight medicine:** ALL pneumothoraces get chest tubes. Period.

### Case 4: The ETT Cuff

**Patient:** 55-year-old female, overdose, intubated for airway protection  
**Ground:** ETT cuff inflated to 25 cm H2O  
**At 8,000 ft:** Pilot hears audible leak around ETT, you notice decreased tidal volumes

**What happened?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** ETT cuff over-expanded and burst (or was under-filled to begin with and expanded too much)

**Why:**
- Gas in ETT cuff expands at altitude (Boyle's Law)
- Over-inflation → cuff bursts
- Or, if under-filled, expansion isn't enough to seal

**What probably happened:**
- Cuff was properly inflated on ground (25 cm H2O)
- At altitude, pressure increased to 30-35 cm H2O
- Exceeded burst pressure → cuff failed

**Action:**
1. **Check cuff pressure with manometer**
   - If zero → cuff burst
   - If high → over-inflated
2. **Attempt to re-inflate** (may not work if burst)
3. **If unable to seal:**
   - Request immediate descent
   - Consider reintubation (difficult in flight)
   - Manual ventilation with good mask seal (temporizing)
   - May need surgical airway if complete obstruction
4. **Adjust ventilator settings** (increase rate/volume to compensate for leak if mild)

**Prevention:**
- Check ETT cuff pressure before flight (use manometer)
- Inflate to 20-25 cm H2O on ground
- Recheck at altitude
- Adjust as needed
- Consider saline-filled cuff (doesn't expand) in long transports

</details>

### Case 5: The Post-Dive Patient

**Patient:** 32-year-old male, scuba diving yesterday (90 ft depth, rapid ascent), now joint pain, skin mottling, confusion  
**Request:** "Can you fly him to the hyperbaric chamber 200 miles away?"

**What do you do?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Decompression Sickness (DCS) - flying will WORSEN it. Ground transport or fly at lowest possible altitude.

**Why:**
- Rapid ascent during dive → nitrogen bubbles in blood/tissues
- Altitude = further decreased pressure → MORE bubbles → worsening DCS
- Henry's Law: gas solubility decreases with pressure
- Flying at altitude will make him worse

**Symptoms of DCS:**
- **Type I (mild):** Joint pain ("the bends"), skin mottling, fatigue
- **Type II (severe):** Neurological symptoms, confusion, paralysis, seizures, cardiac arrest

**Action:**
1. **High-flow O2** (100% NRB - helps off-gas nitrogen)
2. **IV fluids** (rehydration)
3. **Transport decision:**
   - **Ideally:** Ground transport (no altitude exposure)
   - **If air transport necessary:**
     - Fly at LOWEST possible altitude (< 1,000 ft if possible)
     - Pressurized aircraft only (maintain sea-level cabin pressure)
     - Continue 100% O2
     - Monitor neuro status closely
4. **Notify hyperbaric facility** (they need to prepare chamber)
5. **Do NOT delay transport for "stabilization"** (definitive treatment is recompression)

**Prevention:**
- Wait 24 hours after diving before flying
- If symptoms develop: ground transport or very low altitude flight

</details>

## Reflection

Flight physiology isn't optional knowledge—it's critical for safe air medical transport.

Here's what you should know cold:

✅ Gas expands at altitude (Boyle's Law)  
✅ All pneumothoraces need chest tubes before flight  
✅ ETT cuff pressure must be monitored at altitude  
✅ Hypoxia worsens at altitude (Dalton's Law)  
✅ Head injuries with pneumocephalus deteriorate at altitude  
✅ Post-dive patients shouldn't fly (DCS risk)  
✅ Use rigid splints, not air splints  

**Next-level thinking:**
- How do you calculate oxygen requirements at different altitudes?
- What's the pathophysiology of high-altitude pulmonary edema in flight crews?
- How do you manage a full arrest in a helicopter?
- What are the risks of flying immediately post-operative patients?

**Your assignment:**  
Shadow a flight crew. Observe how they prepare patients for altitude. Ask about their most challenging in-flight emergencies. Understand the physiology before you live it.

Because when you're at 8,000 feet with a deteriorating patient, you better know exactly what altitude is doing—and how to fix it.
