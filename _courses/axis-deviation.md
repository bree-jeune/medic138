# Axis Deviation

**Level:** Intermediate  
**Topic:** Cardiology / ECG Interpretation  
**Duration:** 45 minutes

---

## Arrival Scenario

You're called to a 58-year-old male with chest pain. ECG shows ST-segment changes, and your partner says, "We've got a STEMI—let's roll."

You look closer. Lead I shows a deep negative QRS. Lead aVF shows a tall positive QRS. Something's off.

"Wait," you say. "Check the axis."

Your partner stares at you. "The what?"

**This is axis deviation. And it matters more than you think.**

---

## Warm-Up Questions

Before we dive in, test yourself:

1. **What does "cardiac axis" actually mean?**
2. **What's the normal axis range in degrees?**
3. **Which two leads do you need to quickly determine axis?**
4. **What causes left axis deviation?**
5. **Can axis deviation change a STEMI diagnosis?**

Think it through. We'll answer all of these.

## Explanation / Breakdown

### What Is Cardiac Axis?

The **cardiac axis** is the average direction of electrical activity in the heart during ventricular depolarization.

Think of it like this: electricity flows through the heart in a specific direction. That direction can be plotted on a 360° circle. Normal is roughly "down and to the left" (toward the apex).

**Why it matters:**
- Abnormal axis suggests structural changes, conduction blocks, or chamber enlargement
- It helps differentiate certain arrhythmias
- It can reveal misplaced leads or technical errors

### Normal vs. Abnormal Axis

| Axis Type | Degrees | What It Means |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Normal | -30° to +90° | Heart pointing down and left |
| Left Axis Deviation (LAD) | -30° to -90° | Heart pointing up and left |
| Right Axis Deviation (RAD) | +90° to +180° | Heart pointing down and right |
| Extreme RAD / "No Man's Land" | -90° to -180° | Heart pointing up and right (very abnormal) |

### The Fast Method: Lead I and aVF

You don't need a protractor. You need two leads: **I** and **aVF**.

Here's the shortcut:

| Lead I | Lead aVF | Axis |
|--------|----------|------|
| ⬆ Positive | ⬆ Positive | **Normal** |
| ⬆ Positive | ⬇ Negative | **Left Axis Deviation** |
| ⬇ Negative | ⬆ Positive | **Right Axis Deviation** |
| ⬇ Negative | ⬇ Negative | **Extreme RAD** |

**Memory trick:**  
- Both up = Normal (most common)
- Lead I up, aVF down = LAD (think "left")
- Lead I down, aVF up = RAD (think "right")
- Both down = Extreme (think "something's very wrong")

### Why Does Axis Deviate?

**Left Axis Deviation (LAD):**
- Left ventricular hypertrophy (most common)
- Left anterior fascicular block (LAFB)
- Inferior MI (old)
- Left bundle branch block (LBBB)
- Pacing from the RV apex

**Right Axis Deviation (RAD):**
- Right ventricular hypertrophy (chronic lung disease, pulmonary HTN)
- Left posterior fascicular block (LPFB—rare)
- Lateral MI (old)
- Pulmonary embolism (acute right heart strain)
- Normal variant in tall, thin people

**Extreme RAD:**
- Severe RVH
- Ventricular tachycardia
- Lead misplacement (check your stickers)
- Hyperkalemia (late sign)

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Ignoring Axis Altogether
Most medics skip it. Don't. Axis gives you clues about underlying pathology.

### Mistake #2: Confusing "Left Axis" with "Left Bundle Branch"
They're different. LBBB causes a wide QRS. LAD just changes the direction.

### Mistake #3: Assuming RAD = PE
RAD can suggest PE, but it's not diagnostic. You need clinical context.

### Mistake #4: Not Checking for Lead Misplacement
Extreme RAD? Check your leads. Left arm/right arm reversal causes a bizarre axis.

### Mistake #5: Overcalling Axis in Kids
Children and young adults can have RAD as a normal variant. Context matters.

## Clinical Pearls

💎 **Normal axis = Lead I and aVF both positive.** If you see this, move on.

💎 **LAD + RBBB = bifascicular block.** This is significant—it suggests advanced conduction disease.

💎 **New RAD in a hypoxic patient = think PE.** Especially with tachycardia and right heart strain.

💎 **Extreme RAD is never normal.** Always investigate—could be lead misplacement, VT, or severe pathology.

💎 **If Lead I is flat (isoelectric), the axis is exactly +90° or -90°.** This is called an "indeterminate axis."

💎 **Left axis + deep S in V1-V3 = probable LVH.** This is a common pattern in hypertensive patients.

💎 **Axis can change acutely.** MI, PE, and acute cor pulmonale can all shift the axis suddenly.

💎 **Don't let axis distract from the STEMI.** Axis is useful, but identifying STEMI takes priority.

## Decision Trees

### Axis Interpretation Flowchart

```
START: Look at Lead I and aVF
    ↓
Lead I Positive?
    YES → aVF Positive?
        YES → NORMAL AXIS (-30° to +90°)
            ↓
            Proceed with standard ECG interpretation
        NO → LEFT AXIS DEVIATION (-30° to -90°)
            ↓
            Check for:
            - LVH (high voltage in limb leads?)
            - LAFB (qR in aVL, rS in II, III, aVF?)
            - Old inferior MI (Q waves in II, III, aVF?)
    NO → aVF Positive?
        YES → RIGHT AXIS DEVIATION (+90° to +180°)
            ↓
            Check for:
            - RVH (tall R in V1, deep S in V6?)
            - Acute PE (tachycardia, S1Q3T3 pattern?)
            - LPFB (rare, rS in I/aVL, qR in II/III/aVF?)
        NO → EXTREME RAD (-90° to -180°)
            ↓
            Check for:
            - Lead misplacement (most common)
            - VT (wide complex tachycardia?)
            - Severe RVH
            - Hyperkalemia (tall T waves?)
```

### Clinical Action Tree

```
Axis Abnormality Identified
    ↓
Is patient symptomatic?
    YES → Chest pain? SOB? Hypotension?
        ↓
        Treat underlying condition (ACS, PE, CHF)
        Axis is a clue, not the primary problem
    NO → Incidental finding
        ↓
        Document and notify receiving facility
        Consider past ECGs for comparison
        ↓
        Is this new or chronic?
            NEW → Higher concern (MI, PE, block)
            CHRONIC → Likely baseline (LVH, RVH, old MI)
```

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: The Hypertensive Patient

**Patient:** 62-year-old male, history of HTN, chest pain radiating to jaw  
**ECG:** ST elevation in V2-V4, Lead I positive, aVF negative

**What's the axis?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Left Axis Deviation

**Why:**  
- Lead I positive, aVF negative = LAD
- Likely from chronic LVH due to longstanding hypertension

**Clinical Action:**  
- Treat the STEMI (that's the priority)
- LAD is expected in this patient—don't let it distract you
- Activate cath lab, aspirin, nitro per protocol

</details>

---

### Case 2: The Breathless Patient

**Patient:** 34-year-old female, sudden-onset dyspnea, tachycardic (HR 128), recent surgery  
**ECG:** Sinus tachycardia, Lead I negative, aVF positive, S wave in Lead I, Q wave in Lead III, inverted T in Lead III

**What are you thinking?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Right Axis Deviation with S1Q3T3 pattern → think Pulmonary Embolism

**Why:**  
- Lead I negative, aVF positive = RAD
- S1Q3T3 is a classic (but not always present) PE pattern
- Recent surgery + sudden SOB + tachycardia = high pretest probability for PE

**Clinical Action:**  
- High-flow O2
- IV access
- Avoid excessive fluids (right heart is already strained)
- Rapid transport to facility with CT angiography capability
- Notify hospital early

</details>

---

### Case 3: The Cardiac Arrest

**Patient:** 68-year-old male, found in cardiac arrest, ROSC after 2 rounds of epi  
**Post-ROSC ECG:** Wide QRS, Lead I negative, aVF negative, bizarre morphology

**What's going on?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Extreme Right Axis Deviation—could be hyperkalemia, VT, or lead misplacement

**Why:**  
- Lead I negative, aVF negative = Extreme RAD
- Post-arrest patients often have severe metabolic derangements
- Hyperkalemia is common post-arrest and causes extreme axis deviation

**Clinical Action:**  
- Check lead placement first (easiest fix)
- Draw labs immediately (especially K+, pH, lactate)
- If hyperkalemia suspected: calcium chloride, insulin + D50, bicarb
- Continuous monitoring, prepare for rearrest

</details>

---

### Case 4: The Confusing Chest Pain

**Patient:** 55-year-old male, intermittent chest pain, no known cardiac history  
**ECG:** Lead I positive with tall R wave, aVF negative with deep S wave, QRS normal width, high voltage throughout

**What's the likely cause of the axis deviation?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Left Axis Deviation from Left Ventricular Hypertrophy

**Why:**  
- Lead I positive, aVF negative = LAD
- High voltage + LAD = classic LVH pattern
- Likely undiagnosed/untreated hypertension

**Clinical Action:**  
- Evaluate for ACS (troponin, serial ECGs)
- Check BP (likely elevated)
- This is chronic pathology, but still requires cardiology follow-up
- Patient needs echo and BP management

</details>

---

### Case 5: The Pacemaker Patient

**Patient:** 80-year-old female with permanent pacemaker, fall, hip pain  
**ECG:** Paced rhythm, wide QRS with pacing spikes, Lead I positive, aVF negative

**Is this axis normal for a paced patient?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Yes—Left Axis Deviation is expected with RV apical pacing

**Why:**  
- Most pacemakers are placed in the RV apex
- This causes the electrical activity to travel from right to left (LAD)
- Paced rhythms always have abnormal axis

**Clinical Action:**  
- This is normal for this patient
- Focus on the fall evaluation and hip injury
- Check pacemaker function if concerned (interrogate at hospital)

</details>

## Reflection

You now understand cardiac axis—what it is, how to find it fast, and what it tells you.

Here's what you should walk away with:

✅ Axis is the average direction of ventricular depolarization  
✅ Use Lead I and aVF for quick determination  
✅ LAD suggests LVH, LAFB, or old inferior MI  
✅ RAD suggests RVH, LPFB, or acute PE  
✅ Extreme RAD is always abnormal (check leads first)  
✅ Axis adds context, but doesn't replace your primary assessment  

**Next-level thinking:**
- How does axis help differentiate wide-complex tachycardias?
- What's the relationship between axis and bundle branch blocks?
- When should axis deviation change your treatment plan?

**Your assignment:**  
For the next week, check the axis on every 12-lead you run. Build the habit. Make it automatic. Soon you'll spot axis deviations in seconds—and you'll know what they mean.

Pattern recognition starts with repetition.
