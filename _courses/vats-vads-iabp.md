# VATS, VADs, IABP: Mechanical Circulatory Support

**Level:** Advanced
**Topic:** Mechanical Support, Cardiac Devices, EMS/CCU/Flight
**Duration:** Deep Dive

***

## Arrival Scenario

“Device patient, alarm sounding, pressure dropping.”
You arrive to an LVAD (VAD), IABP, or VATS (ventricular assist/transplant support) patient with “no pulse,” “strange alarms,” “new neuro symptoms.” It’s a three-device puzzle, but only one answer saves the patient…

***

## Warm-Up Questions

1. What’s the best rapid assessment if the VAD patient has “no pulse”?
2. Which device complications demand field escalation?
3. How do you differentiate between pump failure and clinical deterioration?
4. What are can’t-miss physical findings in a device-supported patient?
5. How can you provide CPR on VAD/ECMO/IABP if needed?

## Explanation / Breakdown

- **VATS (surgical drainage):** Many field teams do not see these; prioritize bleeding, infection, ventilation, drain positioning.
- **LVAD/VAD:** No pulse, continuous-flow, MAP preferred, device alarms (power, flow, suction, battery)
- **IABP (Balloon Pump):** Augments diastolic flow, triggers on ECG/arterial waveform; risks: migration, loss of augmentation, bleeding
- **Device Trouble:** Alarms, power failure, low flow, suction events, hemolysis, infection.

**Field priorities:** Power-check, device consult, manual backup device if present, treat patient not the monitor, maintain drive lines and anticoagulation.

***

## Common Mistakes

- Failing to confirm device “on” and in correct mode after movement.
- Ignoring field neuro assessment; “normal device” doesn’t mean stable brain.
- Starting chest compressions without device consultation (can dislodge LVAD/IABP).
- Pulling or kinking driveline.

***

## Clinical Pearls

- Always bring spare batteries and check charger before transfer.
- Map, not pulse—use Doppler or arterial line if needed for VAD.
- Alarms = device crisis unless proven otherwise, especially power/flow messages.
- Protect driveline, clear the line, never clamp unless told.

***

## Decision Trees

**Device Action Plan**

1. Patient unresponsive?
    - Check power, connections, alarms, consult device card/hub
2. MAP <60 or signs shock?
    - Fluids, O₂, escalate
3. Alarms:
    - Power: Battery/cable
    - Flow: Device consult/team, back up
    - Bleeding: Pressure, O₂, elevate call
4. CPR?
    - Only after device/family cleared (or peri-arrest)

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: IABP balloon malfunction/alarm—BP falling

### Case 2: LVAD patient, power out, neurologic decline

### Case 3: Driveline pulled out in crash scenario


***

## Reflection

- Which device alarms do you feel least ready for?
- How do you “troubleshoot” a device patient when your monitor gives no pulse?
