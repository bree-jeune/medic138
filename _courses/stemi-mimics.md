# STEMI Mimics

**Level:** Advanced
**Topic:** ECG, Mimics, Critical Care
**Duration:** Deep Dive

***

## Arrival Scenario

“STEMI alert!—but the cath lab calls: ‘Are you sure?’” You notice “classic” elevation, but no reciprocal changes and a weird history: tachycardia, fever, or hypokalemia.
What are your top “false-positive” STEMI mimics, and what’s your system for ruling in/out before the cardiologist goes to wire?

***

## Warm-Up Questions

1. Name two non-ACS causes of ST elevation.
2. What ECG findings argue strongly against acute MI, even with ST-elevations?
3. What clinical histories make you doubt ACS as the cause?
4. How can reciprocal changes help you confirm STEMI?
5. Why is it dangerous to “wait and see” in ambiguous ST elevation?

## Explanation / Breakdown

### Top STEMI Mimics

- **Pericarditis**: Diffuse ST elevation with PR depression, no reciprocal changes
- **Early repolarization**: Young, healthy; “fishhook” notching, upsloping
- **LVH/LBBB/paced rhythm**: Wide QRS, baseline abnormal repolarization
- **Hyperkalemia**: Peaked T waves, wide QRS, pseudo-ST elevation
- **Brugada syndrome**: “Coved” ST elevation, V1–V2, sudden death risk
- **Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy**: Emotional/physical stress, ST-elevation, but angio negative for obstruction


### Approach

- Evaluate history + patterns
- Look for reciprocal depression (more likely true STEMI)
- Check serial ECGs, clinical consensus

***

## Common Mistakes

- Calling every ST elevation a “STEMI,” especially in pericarditis or early repol
- Missing true MI in patients with preexisting LBBB/LVH
- Ignoring clinical story—mechanism matters!

***

## Clinical Pearls

- **Reciprocal changes = more likely true MI.**
- **Diffuse ST elevation with PR depression = pericarditis.**
- **Don’t let ECG findings override your clinical sense—sick patients with atypical stories may still need cath.**
- **Serial ECGs are your friend for borderline calls.**

***

## Decision Trees

**Is it STEMI or not?**

1. Is ST elevation focal, localizing, with clinical ACS?
2. Is there PR depression or diffuse elevation?
3. Are there reciprocal changes?
4. Baseline QRS abnormal?
5. Serial ECGs trending toward or away from MI?

***

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: Diffuse ST/PR Down

- 29M, chest pain after viral syndrome, ECG with widespread ST up, PR down, no reciprocal changes.
> Pericarditis or STEMI?


### Case 2: Classic Hyperkalemia

- 74F, missed dialysis, chest pain, wide QRS, tall T’s, ECG reads “STEMI.”
> What do you look for; what next?

## Reflection 

- Name the last mimic you almost called (or did call) as STEMI.
- How do you “crosscheck yourself” before activating a cath lab?
- What’s your script for communicating uncertainty to a team?
