**Level:** Intermediate  
**Topic:** Emergency Medicine / Wilderness Medicine  
**Duration:** 70 minutes

## Arrival Scenario

It's July in the desert. You're dispatched to a hiking trail for an "unconscious person." Temperature is 112°F.

On arrival, you find a 24-year-old male lying in the shade, surrounded by friends. He's confused, combative, dry skin, flushed. Rectal temp 106.8°F. His friends say he "just got dizzy and passed out" after 6 miles.

One of them asks, "Should we give him water?"

**This is heat stroke. And you have minutes, not hours.**

## Warm-Up Questions

Before we break down environmental emergencies, answer these:

1. **What's the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?**
2. **What are the stages of hypothermia?**
3. **What is "rewarming shock"?**
4. **How do you treat frostbite in the field?**
5. **What's the J wave (Osborn wave) and when do you see it?**

These aren't academic. They're survival medicine.

## Explanation / Breakdown

### Heat-Related Emergencies

#### Heat Cramps
**What it is:** Painful muscle spasms from electrolyte loss (Na+, K+)

**Presentation:**
- Cramping in legs, arms, abdomen
- Heavy sweating
- Normal mental status
- Normal core temperature

**Management:**
- Rest in cool environment
- Oral rehydration (water + electrolytes)
- Gentle stretching

#### Heat Exhaustion
**What it is:** Volume depletion + electrolyte loss from heat exposure

**Presentation:**
- Heavy sweating (key finding)
- Weakness, fatigue
- Headache, nausea, dizziness
- Core temp: 100-104°F
- **Normal mental status** (if altered → heat stroke)

**Management:**
- Remove from heat
- Cool environment
- IV fluids (1-2L NS)
- Cooling measures (wet towels, fan)
- Monitor for progression to heat stroke

#### Heat Stroke
**What it is:** Life-threatening failure of thermoregulation

**Presentation:**
- **Altered mental status** (hallmark)
- Core temp > 104°F (often > 106°F)
- Hot, DRY skin (classic) OR sweating (exertional)
- Seizures, coma
- Tachycardia, hypotension
- Multi-organ failure

**Two Types:**
- **Classic (non-exertional):** Elderly, chronic illness, medications, hot environment, DRY skin
- **Exertional:** Young, athletic, physical activity, may still be SWEATING

**Management:**
- **COOL IMMEDIATELY** (every minute counts)
  - Remove clothing
  - Cold water immersion (if available—most effective)
  - Ice packs to groin, axillae, neck
  - Wet sheets + fan
  - **Goal:** Reduce temp to 102°F within 30 minutes
- Airway management (often need intubation)
- Large-bore IV access
- Aggressive IV fluids (NS or LR)
- Treat seizures (benzodiazepines)
- Monitor for rhabdomyolysis, DIC, renal failure
- **Rapid transport** to ICU-capable facility

**Critical Pearl:** Heat stroke = altered mental status + elevated temp. If they're confused and hot, it's heat stroke until proven otherwise.

### Cold-Related Emergencies

#### Hypothermia Stages

| Stage | Core Temp | Signs/Symptoms | Treatment |
|-------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Mild** | 32-35°C (90-95°F) | Shivering, tachycardia, tachypnea, ataxia, impaired judgment | Passive rewarming, warm environment, blankets, warm fluids PO |
| **Moderate** | 28-32°C (82-90°F) | Shivering stops, bradycardia, bradypnea, confusion, decreased LOC, arrhythmias | Active external rewarming (heat packs, Bair Hugger), warm IV fluids |
| **Severe** | < 28°C (< 82°F) | Coma, absent reflexes, rigid muscles, VF/asystole, appears dead | Active internal rewarming (warm IV fluids, heated O2, ECMO, bypass) |

**J Wave (Osborn Wave):**
- ECG finding in hypothermia
- Positive deflection at J point (QRS-ST junction)
- Looks like a "hump" after QRS
- Seen in moderate-severe hypothermia

**Management Principles:**
- **Handle gently** - rough handling can trigger VF
- **No CPR if pulse present** (even if very slow)
- **CPR if no pulse** - continue until rewarmed
- **"Not dead until warm and dead"** - continue resuscitation efforts
- Warm fluids (38-42°C)
- Cardiac monitoring (expect arrhythmias)
- **No pronouncement until core temp > 32°C**

**Rewarming Shock:**
- Hypotension during rewarming
- Caused by:
  - Peripheral vasodilation → decreased SVR
  - Cold, acidotic blood from periphery returning to core
  - Relative hypovolemia
- **Prevention:** Rewarm core before extremities, IV fluids

#### Frostbite

**Classification:**

**Superficial (Frostnip):**
- Skin pale, numb
- No tissue loss
- Rewarms pink

**Superficial Frostbite:**
- Clear blisters
- Skin red/purple after rewarming
- Minimal tissue loss

**Deep Frostbite:**
- Hemorrhagic blisters
- Skin purple/black after rewarming
- Significant tissue loss
- May require amputation

**Field Management:**
- **Do NOT rewarm if risk of refreezing** (causes more damage)
- Remove wet clothing, jewelry
- Protect affected area (sterile dressings, padding)
- **Do NOT rub or massage**
- **Do NOT break blisters**
- Pain management (rewarming is extremely painful)
- If rewarming in field:
  - Use warm water (37-39°C / 98-102°F)
  - Immerse affected part for 15-30 minutes
  - Until tissue is soft and red
  - Expect severe pain

### High-Altitude Illness

#### Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)
**What it is:** Mild altitude illness from rapid ascent

**Presentation (above 8,000 ft):**
- Headache (required for diagnosis)
- Nausea, vomiting
- Fatigue, dizziness
- Insomnia

**Management:**
- Stop ascent
- Rest, hydrate
- Acetazolamide (Diamox)
- Descend if worsening
- Oxygen if available

#### High-Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE)
**What it is:** Severe, life-threatening brain swelling from altitude

**Presentation:**
- Severe headache
- **Ataxia** (can't walk heel-to-toe—diagnostic sign)
- Confusion, altered mental status
- Coma
- Death if untreated

**Management:**
- **IMMEDIATE DESCENT** (only definitive treatment)
- Oxygen (high-flow)
- Dexamethasone 8 mg IV/IM
- Hyperbaric chamber (portable Gamow bag)
- Airway management if obtunded

#### High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE)
**What it is:** Fluid accumulation in lungs from altitude

**Presentation:**
- Dyspnea at rest
- Cough (dry → productive, frothy)
- Crackles, wheezing
- Cyanosis
- Tachycardia, tachypnea

**Management:**
- **IMMEDIATE DESCENT**
- Oxygen (high-flow, keep SpO2 > 90%)
- Nifedipine 30 mg extended-release PO
- Hyperbaric chamber
- Keep warm (cold worsens)
- CPAP if available

**Critical Pearl:** HACE and HAPE are FATAL without descent. Medications buy time, but getting down saves lives.

### Submersion Injuries (Drowning)

**Drowning = respiratory impairment from submersion in liquid**

**Classification:**
- **Non-fatal drowning:** Survived (with or without injuries)
- **Fatal drowning:** Death from drowning

**Pathophysiology:**
- Breath-holding → hypoxia
- Aspiration (or laryngospasm)
- Hypoxic brain injury
- Hypothermia (if cold water)

**Presentation:**
- Coughing, dyspnea
- Hypoxia, cyanosis
- Altered mental status
- Pulmonary edema
- Cardiac arrest

**Management:**
- **C-spine precautions if diving/trauma suspected**
- Airway management
  - Suction
  - High-flow O2
  - CPAP/BiPAP if conscious
  - Intubation if severe
- Cardiac monitoring
- Rewarm if hypothermic
- **All drowning victims need hospital evaluation** (delayed pulmonary edema)

**Cold Water Drowning:**
- Hypothermia protective (slows metabolism)
- Prolonged submersion with survival possible
- Continue resuscitation until rewarmed

**Do NOT attempt abdominal thrusts or "drain water"** - it doesn't work and delays CPR.

---

### Lightning and Electrical Injuries

**Lightning Strike Pathophysiology:**
- Massive DC current (30,000-50,000 amps)
- Duration: milliseconds
- Can cause:
  - Cardiac arrest (asystole more common than VF)
  - Respiratory arrest (prolonged apnea)
  - Neurological injury
  - Burns (superficial and deep)
  - Trauma (blast effect)

**Presentation:**
- Cardiac arrest
- Confusion, amnesia, paralysis
- Tympanic membrane rupture
- Burns (Lichtenberg figures—fernlike patterns)
- Blunt trauma from being thrown

**Management:**
- **Reverse triage** (treat "dead" first—they may recover with CPR)
- CPR if arrested
- Cardiac monitoring (arrhythmias common)
- Cervical spine precautions
- Treat burns
- Monitor for rhabdomyolysis, compartment syndrome

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Waiting to Cool Heat Stroke
Every minute of hyperthermia = more brain damage. Cool first, transport second.

### Mistake #2: Aggressive Rewarming in Severe Hypothermia
Rewarming too fast causes rewarming shock. Core before periphery.

### Mistake #3: Rewarming Frostbite When Refreezing Is Possible
Thaw-refreeze-thaw causes worse tissue damage. Protect and transport.

### Mistake #4: Assuming All Victims at a Lightning Strike Are Dead
"Reverse triage" - those who appear dead may recover. Prioritize them.

### Mistake #5: Missing Delayed Pulmonary Edema After Drowning
All drowning victims need hospital evaluation, even if they seem fine.

### Mistake #6: Giving Up CPR Too Soon in Cold Water Drowning
Hypothermia is protective. "Not dead until warm and dead."

## Clinical Pearls

💎 **Heat stroke = hot + altered.** If they're confused and febrile, assume heat stroke.

💎 **Cool heat stroke patients aggressively.** Cold water immersion is best. Ice packs to neck, groin, axillae work too.

💎 **Hypothermia causes "metabolic iceberg."** Bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia are expected.

💎 **J waves (Osborn waves) = hypothermia.** Seen at core temp < 32°C.

💎 **HACE = can't walk straight.** Ataxia is the key diagnostic sign.

💎 **HAPE and HACE need descent.** Medications are temporizing. Get them down.

💎 **All frostbite patients get pain meds before rewarming.** It's excruciating.

💎 **Lightning victims in asystole can be saved.** Don't give up early.

💎 **Cold water drowning = prolonged resuscitation.** Continue until core temp > 32°C.

💎 **Never break frostbite blisters.** Sterile dressings, leave them intact.

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: The Marathon Runner

**Patient:** 32-year-old male, collapsed at mile 24 of marathon  
**Exam:** Confused, agitated, hot/dry skin, tachycardia 142  
**Temp:** 105.8°F rectal  
**Bystander:** "He was fine, then he started stumbling and fell."

**What's your management?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Exertional Heat Stroke - immediate aggressive cooling required

**Why:**
- Altered mental status (confused, agitated) = heat stroke
- Core temp > 104°F
- Hot skin (may be dry OR sweating in exertional heat stroke)
- This is LIFE-THREATENING

**Action:**
1. **COOL IMMEDIATELY**
   - Remove all clothing
   - If cold water immersion available (ice bath, tub) → USE IT (most effective)
   - If not: ice packs to neck, groin, axillae + wet sheets + fan
2. Airway management (may need sedation + intubation if combative)
3. Large-bore IV access x2
4. NS bolus 1-2L
5. Cardiac monitoring (arrhythmias common)
6. Check glucose (hypoglycemia common)
7. Treat seizures if occur (lorazepam 2-4 mg IV)
8. Recheck temp every 5 minutes
9. **Stop cooling at 102°F** (prevent overcooling)
10. Rapid transport
11. Labs at hospital: CK (rhabdo), renal function, coags (DIC), LFTs

**Every minute counts. Cooling is the priority over everything else.**

### Case 2: The Homeless Patient

**Patient:** 68-year-old male, found unresponsive in park, outside temp 28°F  
**Exam:** Cold to touch, rigid, no obvious breathing, weak carotid pulse (30 bpm)  
**Temp:** 26°C (78.8°F) rectal  
**ECG:** Sinus bradycardia with J waves

**What do you do?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Severe hypothermia with pulse - gentle handling, active rewarming, no CPR

**Why:**
- Core temp < 28°C = severe hypothermia
- Pulse present (even if very slow)
- J waves on ECG confirm hypothermia
- Rigid, appears dead (but isn't)

**Action:**
1. **Handle VERY gently** (rough movement → VF)
2. **Do NOT start CPR** (pulse is present)
3. Remove wet clothing
4. Dry patient
5. Insulate with blankets
6. **Active rewarming:**
   - Heat packs to trunk (NOT extremities)
   - Warm IV fluids (38-42°C)
   - Heated oxygen if available
7. Cardiac monitoring
8. IV access
9. Check glucose (hypoglycemia common in hypothermia)
10. **Transport to facility with ECMO/bypass capability**
11. Continue rewarming during transport

**Do NOT:**
- Rewarm extremities first (causes rewarming shock)
- Give cold IV fluids
- Handle roughly
- Assume patient is dead

**Prognosis depends on rewarming success. Many survive with aggressive rewarming.**

### Case 3: The Mountain Climber

**Patient:** 35-year-old male, climbing at 14,000 ft, severe headache, vomiting, can't walk straight  
**Exam:** Ataxic gait (can't do heel-to-toe), confused, SpO2 82%  
**Friend:** "We came up too fast. He's been sick for 12 hours."

**What's the diagnosis and treatment?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** High-Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) - immediate descent required

**Why:**
- Altitude > 8,000 ft
- Severe headache + ataxia = HACE (diagnostic)
- Confusion (worsening)
- This is LIFE-THREATENING

**Action:**
1. **IMMEDIATE DESCENT** (only definitive treatment - DO NOT DELAY)
2. High-flow oxygen (keep SpO2 > 90%)
3. Dexamethasone 8 mg IV/IM (or 4 mg PO if no IV)
4. Hyperbaric chamber (Gamow bag) if available (temporizing, not definitive)
5. Airway management if worsening LOC
6. Keep warm
7. Descend as low as possible (even 1,000-2,000 ft helps)

**Do NOT:**
- Continue ascent or stay at altitude
- Assume it will resolve on its own
- Delay descent to "see if meds work"

**HACE is fatal without descent. Every hour at altitude = more brain damage.**

</details>

### Case 4: The Drowning Victim

**Patient:** 6-year-old boy, pulled from pool after ~3 minutes, bystander CPR started  
**Exam:** Unconscious, agonal respirations, weak pulse 50 bpm, cold to touch  
**Temp:** 32°C (89.6°F)

**What's your management?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Cold water drowning with pulse - aggressive airway management + rewarming

**Why:**
- Submersion injury
- Hypothermia (cold water protective)
- Pulse present (even if weak)
- Agonal breathing (inadequate ventilation)

**Action:**
1. **C-spine precautions** (diving/trauma can't be ruled out)
2. **Aggressive airway management:**
   - Suction (if needed)
   - BVM with 100% O2
   - Likely needs intubation (agonal respirations)
3. Cardiac monitoring
4. IV/IO access
5. **Rewarming:**
   - Remove wet clothing
   - Dry patient
   - Warm blankets
   - Warm IV fluids (if giving)
   - Heated oxygen
6. Transport to pediatric ICU
7. Monitor for:
   - Pulmonary edema (delayed)
   - Arrhythmias
   - Neurological injury

**Do NOT:**
- Attempt abdominal thrusts to "drain water"
- Give up resuscitation early (hypothermia is protective)
- Skip hospital transport even if patient improves

**All drowning victims need hospital evaluation (delayed pulmonary edema can occur hours later).**

</details>

### Case 5: The Lightning Strike

**Scene:** Multiple people struck by lightning during storm  
**Victim 1:** Conscious, confused, burns to leg  
**Victim 2:** Unconscious, no pulse, no respirations  
**Victim 3:** Conscious, complaining of ear pain and vision changes

**Who do you treat first?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Victim 2 (the "dead" one) - REVERSE TRIAGE in lightning strikes

**Why:**
- Lightning causes asystole/prolonged apnea
- Victim 2 may recover with CPR (respiratory arrest likely)
- Victims 1 and 3 are conscious → stable for now
- **Reverse triage:** Treat the dead first (opposite of mass casualty triage)

**Action for Victim 2:**
1. **Begin CPR immediately**
2. AED/cardiac monitor
3. Airway management
4. IV access
5. C-spine precautions (blast effect)
6. Continue resuscitation (better prognosis than typical cardiac arrest)

**Action for Victim 1:**
- C-spine precautions
- Cardiac monitoring (arrhythmias common)
- Treat burns
- Neurological assessment
- Monitor for rhabdomyolysis

**Action for Victim 3:**
- Assess for TM rupture (ear pain)
- Visual assessment (corneal injury, cataracts)
- Neurological exam
- Cardiac monitoring

**All lightning victims need transport and monitoring (delayed complications common).**

</details>

## Reflection

Environmental emergencies are high-stakes, time-sensitive calls.

Here's what you should know:

✅ Heat stroke = altered mental status + elevated temp (cool immediately)  
✅ Hypothermia stages + rewarming strategies (core before periphery)  
✅ Frostbite management (do NOT rewarm if refreezing possible)  
✅ HACE/HAPE = immediate descent (only definitive treatment)  
✅ Drowning = all need hospital evaluation (delayed pulmonary edema)  
✅ Lightning = reverse triage (treat dead first)  

**Next-level thinking:**
- How does humidity affect heat illness?
- What's the pathophysiology of rewarming shock?
- When do you use hyperbaric oxygen for environmental emergencies?
- How do environmental extremes affect medication pharmacokinetics?

**Your assignment:**  
Know your local environment. Desert? Prepare for heat. Mountains? Know altitude illness. Coast? Understand drowning. Winter? Master hypothermia.

Because when environmental emergencies hit, you're the only thing standing between your patient and nature.
