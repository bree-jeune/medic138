# Gas Laws for Flight and Critical Care

**Level:** Advanced
**Topic:** Flight Physiology, Gas Laws, Hyperbarics
**Duration:** Comprehensive deep dive

***

## Arrival Scenario

You’re dispatched on a helicopter transfer with a trauma patient. During ascent, the SpO₂ drops, the ETT cuff pressure increases, and the IV pump alarms. You notice the balloon on the OG tube inflating. It’s time to think like a medic:
What are the gas laws at play here? What real-world risks do altitude and pressure changes create for your patient?

***

## Warm-Up Questions

1. Which gas law explains why the ETT cuff expands during ascent?
2. How does altitude affect oxygenation?
3. What should you monitor on ventilated patients during a flight?
4. Why might a trauma patient desaturate more quickly at altitude?
5. How do barometric pressure changes impact IV infusions and medication delivery?

## Explanation / Breakdown

### 1. **Core Gas Laws Relevant to Flight \& Critical Care**

- **Boyle’s Law:** As pressure decreases, volume increases.
*Applies to ETT cuffs, air in syringes, GI tract gas. So at altitude (lower pressure), internal air expands.*
- **Dalton’s Law:** The total pressure of a mixture of gases equals the sum of partial pressures.
*Explains why the oxygen fraction in air changes as pressure drops—affecting available O₂ for the patient.*
- **Henry’s Law:** The amount of gas dissolved in liquid is proportional to the gas’s partial pressure.
*Relevant for nitrogen coming out of solution in blood/tissues (decompression sickness risk).*
- **Fick’s Law:** Rate of gas transfer depends on surface area, diffusion characteristics, and partial pressure gradient.
*Critical for understanding oxygen movement in hypoxic conditions.*
- **Charles’ Law:** Volume of gas is proportional to temperature at constant pressure.
*Less impact in typical EMS flight—but know for advanced breath analysis.*


### 2. **Field Application**

- **Airway Devices:** Cuffs, balloons, and any air-filled devices can expand rapidly at altitude – risking mucosal damage.
- **Chest Tubes \& Pneumothorax:** Boyle’s law means trapped gas volume increases with ascent.
- **IV Fluids:** Decreased pressure may cause air bubbles to form or grow in lines/syringes.
- **Oxygenation:** Dalton’s/Henry’s show why patients may desaturate at altitude, especially those with head/chest injuries or pulmonary compromise.
- **Analgesia \& Sedation:** Reduced solubility of gases in blood may change drug effectiveness, especially with inhaled agents.

## Common Mistakes

- Failing to remove air from ETT or OG tube balloons before flight.
- Ignoring SpO₂ drops in stable patients—assuming monitor error instead of altitude hypoxia.
- Trusting ground-level ventilator settings after ascent.
- Not prepping pressure-sensitive devices for changes (e.g., infusions, syringes).
- Overlooking decompression illness in certain trauma or scuba patients.

***

## Clinical Pearls

- Always fill cuffs/balloons with saline, not air, before a flight.
- Check and adjust ventilator settings after any altitude change.
- In patients with pneumo, monitor for expansion and tension pneumothorax during ascent.
- Know that hypoxia can develop quickly, even in “stable” ground-level saturations.
- Documentation: Record cabin altitude and atmospheric changes during transport events—helps correlate with patient signs.

## Decision Trees

**Scenario: Airway device management during flight**

- Does the patient have any air-filled tubes/balloons?
    - Yes → Remove air, fill with saline.
    - No → Proceed to airway/ventilator check.
- Is patient ventilated?
    - Yes → Check vent settings, monitor for increased inspiratory pressures, adjust FiO₂ up as needed.
    - No → Monitor SpO₂ closely, pre-oxygenate before altitude change.
- Any signs of trapped gas syndromes (pneumo, barotrauma, GI distension)?
    - Yes → Prepare for decompression, reassess with ascent.
    - No → Monitor and reassess regularly.

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: The Expanding Cuff

- Pt: 45M, trauma, intubated, ground SpO₂ 98%
- After ascent (8,000 ft): SpO₂ drops to 90%, cuff feels firm.
- Timeline: 0min—takeoff; 10min—desaturation; 15min—cuff balloon looks tense.
- Vitals: HR 110, BP 132/80, RR 18 (vent), Temp 36.8°C.
> What gas law applies? What’s your move?


### Case 2: Sudden Pneumothorax

- Pt: 33F, blunt chest trauma, stable on ground.
- At 6,000ft: sudden dyspnea, chest pain, SpO₂ from 95% → 85%
- Timeline: 0min—takeoff; 12min—pain/dyspnea; 14min—tension signs.
- Vitals: HR 120, BP 90/68, RR 26, Temp 37.0°C
> How do Boyle’s and Henry’s Law explain this? How do you intervene?


### Case 3: Medication Infusion Trouble

- Pt: 27M, septic, on norepinephrine drip. IV pump alarms for "air in line" after ascent.
- Timeline: 0min—takeoff; 5min—pump alarm; 10min—hypotension.
- Vitals: HR 124, BP 84/60, RR 20, SpO₂ 93%, Temp 37.2°C
> What risk does altitude expose? Next steps?


### Case 4: GI Distension

- Pt: 60F, intubated, NG tube balloon inflated.
- At 10,000ft, balloon expands, pt difficult to ventilate.
- Timeline: 2min—takeoff; 18min—vent alarm.
- Vitals: HR 100, BP 138/78, RR 14 (vent), SpO₂ 97%, Temp 36.4°C
> What’s happening physiologically? Action plan?


### Case 5: Head Injury and Hypoxia at Altitude

- Pt: 18M, acute TBI, GCS 6, stable SpO₂ on ground, not ventilated.
- After rapid climb: SpO₂ dips to 88%, agitated response.
- Timeline: 0min—takeoff; 5min—desaturation/agitation.
- Vitals: HR 112, BP 118/80, RR 22, Temp 36.9°C
> How are gas laws affecting neuro outcome? Field maneuvers?


### Case 6: Decompression Sickness Post-Scuba

- Pt: 40M, diver, acute joint pain, confusion after helicopter ascent.
- Timeline: 0min—takeoff; 8min—pain, confusion.
- Vitals: HR 96, BP 140/90, RR 20, SpO₂ 95%, Temp 36.6°C
> What law is key here? What’s your critical action?

## Reflection

**Structured Questions:**

- Which gas law do you feel strongest with, and which needs review?
- Describe a real or simulated transport where altitude affected patient outcome.
- What steps could you add to your pre-flight checklist to prevent device and patient complications?
- How does understanding these gas laws change your clinical confidence in the field?
