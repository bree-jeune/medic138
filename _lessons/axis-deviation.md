## Arrival Scenario

You're called to a 58-year-old male with chest pain. ECG shows ST-segment changes, and your partner says, "We've got a STEMI—let's roll."

You look closer. Lead I shows a deep negative QRS. Lead aVF shows a tall positive QRS. Something's off.

"Wait," you say. "Check the axis."

**This is axis deviation. And it matters more than you think.**

## What Is Cardiac Axis?

The **cardiac axis** is the average direction of electrical activity during ventricular depolarization.

Normal is roughly "down and to the left" (toward the apex).

**Why it matters:**
- Suggests structural changes, conduction blocks, or chamber enlargement
- Helps differentiate certain arrhythmias
- Can reveal misplaced leads

## Normal vs. Abnormal Axis

| Axis Type | Degrees |
|-----------|---------|
| Normal | -30° to +90° |
| Left Axis Deviation (LAD) | -30° to -90° |
| Right Axis Deviation (RAD) | +90° to +180° |
| Extreme RAD | -90° to -180° |

## The Fast Method: Lead I and aVF

| Lead I | Lead aVF | Axis |
|--------|----------|------|
| ⬆ Positive | ⬆ Positive | **Normal** |
| ⬆ Positive | ⬇ Negative | **Left Axis Deviation** |
| ⬇ Negative | ⬆ Positive | **Right Axis Deviation** |
| ⬇ Negative | ⬇ Negative | **Extreme RAD** |

**Memory trick:**
- Both up = Normal
- Lead I up, aVF down = LAD ("left")
- Lead I down, aVF up = RAD ("right")
- Both down = Extreme (something's very wrong)

## Why Does Axis Deviate?

**Left Axis Deviation (LAD):**
- Left ventricular hypertrophy
- Left anterior fascicular block (LAFB)
- Inferior MI (old)
- Left bundle branch block

**Right Axis Deviation (RAD):**
- Right ventricular hypertrophy
- Pulmonary embolism (acute)
- Left posterior fascicular block
- Normal in tall, thin people

**Extreme RAD:**
- Lead misplacement (check first!)
- Ventricular tachycardia
- Severe RVH
- Hyperkalemia

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Ignoring Axis Altogether
Axis gives you clues about underlying pathology. Don't skip it.

### Mistake #2: Confusing LAD with LBBB
LBBB causes a wide QRS. LAD just changes direction.

### Mistake #3: Assuming RAD = PE
RAD can suggest PE, but needs clinical context.

### Mistake #4: Not Checking for Lead Misplacement
Extreme RAD? Check your stickers. Arm reversal causes bizarre axis.

## Clinical Pearls

💎 **Normal axis = Lead I and aVF both positive.** Move on.

💎 **LAD + RBBB = bifascicular block.** Significant conduction disease.

💎 **New RAD in a hypoxic patient = think PE.**

💎 **Extreme RAD is never normal.** Always investigate.

💎 **Left axis + deep S in V1-V3 = probable LVH.**

💎 **Axis can change acutely.** MI, PE can shift it suddenly.

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: The Hypertensive Patient

**Patient:** 62-year-old male, HTN, chest pain  
**ECG:** ST elevation V2-V4, Lead I positive, aVF negative

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Left Axis Deviation (likely from LVH)

**Action:** Treat the STEMI. LAD is expected in this patient—don't let it distract you.

</details>

---

### Case 2: The Breathless Patient

**Patient:** 34-year-old female, sudden dyspnea, HR 128, recent surgery  
**ECG:** Sinus tach, Lead I negative, aVF positive, S1Q3T3 pattern

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Right Axis Deviation + S1Q3T3 → think Pulmonary Embolism

**Action:** High-flow O2, IV, avoid excessive fluids, rapid transport for CT angiography.

</details>

---

### Case 3: The Cardiac Arrest

**Patient:** 68-year-old male, post-ROSC  
**ECG:** Wide QRS, Lead I negative, aVF negative

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Extreme RAD — could be hyperkalemia, VT, or lead misplacement

**Action:** Check leads first. Draw labs (K+). If hyperkalemia suspected: calcium, insulin + D50.

</details>

## Reflection

✅ Axis is the average direction of ventricular depolarization  
✅ Use Lead I and aVF for quick determination  
✅ LAD suggests LVH, LAFB, or old inferior MI  
✅ RAD suggests RVH, LPFB, or PE  
✅ Extreme RAD is always abnormal  

For the next week, check the axis on every 12-lead. Make it automatic.
