## Arrival Scenario

You're transporting a 42-year-old male from a rural ED to a trauma center. GSW to abdomen, emergent ex-lap, lost 2 liters in the OR. He's hypotensive (BP 82/50), tachy (HR 135), pale, and cold.

The surgeon hands you 4 units of PRBCs and 2 units of FFP. "He needs these on the way. Massive transfusion protocol. You good?"

**Because when you're moving blood, mistakes kill fast.**

## Blood Product Basics

### Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBCs)
- **What it does:** Carries oxygen, increases Hgb
- **Volume:** ~300 mL per unit
- **Raises Hgb by:** ~1 g/dL per unit
- **When to use:** Hemorrhage, severe anemia (Hgb < 7)

### Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)
- **What it does:** Replaces clotting factors
- **Volume:** ~250 mL per unit
- **When to use:** Massive transfusion, coagulopathy, warfarin reversal

### Platelets
- **What it does:** Stops bleeding, helps clotting
- **Volume:** ~300 mL per unit
- **When to use:** Thrombocytopenia (< 50K in bleeding patient)

---

## Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP)

**1:1:1 Ratio:** 1 PRBCs : 1 FFP : 1 Platelets

**Why?** Giving only PRBCs dilutes clotting factors → coagulopathy

**Activation criteria:**
- Loss of 1 blood volume in 24 hours
- > 4 units PRBCs in 1 hour
- Shock + ongoing bleeding

---

## Blood Compatibility

| Recipient | Can Receive |
|-----------|-------------|
| O- | O- only (Universal Donor) |
| O+ | O-, O+ |
| AB+ | All types (Universal Recipient) |

**In emergencies:** Use O- PRBCs, AB plasma

---

## Administration Rules

1. **Verify TWICE** (patient name, DOB, blood type, unit number)
2. **Blood tubing** with 170-micron filter (NEVER standard IV set)
3. **Use NS only** (No LR, No D5W)
4. **Blood warmer** for rapid transfusion
5. **Max hang time:** 4 hours per unit
6. **Rate:** Wide open in hemorrhage, 2-4 hours in stable patients

---

## Transfusion Reactions

### Acute Hemolytic (ABO incompatibility)
- **Signs:** Fever, back pain, hypotension, dark urine, shock
- **Action:** STOP immediately, NS, treat shock

### Febrile Non-Hemolytic
- **Signs:** Fever, chills
- **Action:** Slow/stop, acetaminophen

### Allergic
- **Signs:** Urticaria, itching, flushing
- **Action:** Stop, Benadryl

### Anaphylaxis
- **Signs:** Respiratory distress, angioedema, shock
- **Action:** Stop, epi 0.3-0.5 mg IM, airway management

### TRALI
- **Signs:** Acute respiratory distress, hypoxia, bilateral infiltrates
- **Action:** Stop, supportive care (O2, CPAP)

### TACO
- **Signs:** Dyspnea, HTN, JVD, crackles, pulmonary edema
- **Action:** Stop/slow, diuretics, CPAP

## Clinical Pearls

💎 **O- PRBCs are liquid gold.** Use type-specific when possible.

💎 **1:1:1 saves lives.** Balanced resuscitation prevents coagulopathy.

💎 **Check within 15 minutes.** Most acute reactions happen early.

💎 **Hypothermia kills.** Warm the blood, warm the patient.

💎 **Back pain during transfusion = hemolytic reaction.** Stop immediately.

💎 **When in doubt, STOP.** You can always restart.

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: The Reaction

**Patient:** 65-year-old female, GI bleed, receiving 2nd unit PRBCs  
**Event:** 20 minutes in, severe back pain, fever 101.8°F, BP dropping to 88/52

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction

**Action:**
- STOP transfusion IMMEDIATELY
- New IV with NS, run wide open
- Send blood unit back to blood bank
- Treat shock
- Draw hemolysis labs

</details>

### Case 2: The CHF Patient

**Patient:** 80-year-old female, CHF (EF 25%), symptomatic anemia, Hgb 6.8

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Concern:** Risk of TACO (volume overload)

**Action:**
- Transfuse slowly (2-4 hours per unit)
- Pre-medicate with Lasix if ordered
- Monitor closely for overload
- Stop if crackles/dyspnea develop

</details>

## Reflection

✅ Blood product types and indications  
✅ Massive transfusion protocol (1:1:1)  
✅ ABO compatibility and universal donors  
✅ Administration rules  
✅ Transfusion reaction recognition and response  

When you're the only thing between your patient and exsanguination, you better know what you're doing.
