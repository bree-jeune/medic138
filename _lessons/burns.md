## Arrival Scenario

You're dispatched to a house fire. A 45-year-old male self-extricated before your arrival. He's conscious, in severe pain, with burns covering both arms, his entire chest, and his face. His eyebrows are singed. He's coughing up black sputum.

Your partner starts calling out percentages. The patient's screaming. Bystanders are yelling. Everyone's asking you what to do.

**This is where burn assessment skills separate good medics from great ones.**

## Warm-Up Questions

1. What's the Rule of Nines for adults?
2. What defines a superficial vs. partial-thickness vs. full-thickness burn?
3. What fluid resuscitation formula do you use for burns?
4. What are the signs of inhalation injury?
5. When does a burn patient need a burn center?

## Burn Depth Classification

### Superficial (First-Degree)
- **Damage:** Epidermis only
- **Appearance:** Red, painful, dry, no blisters
- **Example:** Mild sunburn
- **Treatment:** Minor, doesn't count toward TBSA for fluid resuscitation

### Partial-Thickness (Second-Degree)
**Superficial Partial:**
- **Damage:** Epidermis + upper dermis
- **Appearance:** Red, very painful, blisters, moist
- **Heals:** 2-3 weeks, minimal scarring

**Deep Partial:**
- **Damage:** Epidermis + deep dermis
- **Appearance:** White/yellow, less painful, may blister
- **Heals:** 3-8 weeks, significant scarring

### Full-Thickness (Third-Degree)
- **Damage:** Entire dermis + subcutaneous tissue
- **Appearance:** White, brown, leathery, dry, charred
- **Sensation:** **Painless** (nerve endings destroyed)
- **Heals:** Does NOT heal on its own, needs grafting

## Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) Estimation

### Rule of Nines (Adult)

| Body Region | Percentage |
|-------------|------------|
| Head & Neck | 9% |
| Each Arm | 9% |
| Each Leg | 18% |
| Anterior Trunk | 18% |
| Posterior Trunk | 18% |
| Perineum | 1% |

**Total = 100%**

### Palm Method
- Patient's **palm = 1% TBSA**
- Useful for scattered burns

---

## Fluid Resuscitation: Parkland Formula

**For burns > 20% TBSA:**

**4 mL x weight (kg) x % TBSA = Total fluid in 24 hours**

**First 8 hours:** Give 50% of total  
**Next 16 hours:** Give remaining 50%

**Use Lactated Ringer's (LR) - NOT normal saline**

**Example:**  
70 kg patient, 30% TBSA burn  
4 x 70 x 30 = 8,400 mL in 24 hours  
First 8 hours: 4,200 mL (525 mL/hour)

---

## Inhalation Injury

**Suspect if:**
- Fire in enclosed space
- Facial burns
- Singed nasal hairs or eyebrows
- Carbonaceous sputum (black/sooty)
- Hoarseness, stridor, wheezing

**Management:**
- High-flow O2 (100% NRB or BVM)
- Early intubation if any concern (don't wait for stridor)
- Large ETT (7.5-8.0)

---

## Burn Center Criteria (ABA Guidelines)

1. Partial-thickness > 10% TBSA
2. Full-thickness burns (any size)
3. Burns to face, hands, feet, genitals, major joints
4. Chemical or electrical burns
5. Inhalation injury
6. Circumferential burns

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Including First-Degree Burns in TBSA
Superficial burns don't count toward fluid resuscitation calculations.

### Mistake #2: Applying Ice or Cold Water
Causes hypothermia. Use room-temperature water or saline-soaked dressings.

### Mistake #3: Delaying Intubation in Inhalation Injury
Airway swelling happens FAST. If you think they need a tube, they need it NOW.

### Mistake #4: Popping Blisters
Leave them intact. They're sterile and protective.

## Clinical Pearls

💎 **If it doesn't hurt, it's worse.** Full-thickness burns are painless.

💎 **Stridor = imminent airway loss.** Intubate immediately.

💎 **CO poisoning is silent.** Pulse ox looks normal (can't differentiate COHgb).

💎 **Remove rings, watches, belts immediately.** Swelling will make them tourniquets.

💎 **Wet dressings for small burns, dry for large burns.** Large wet dressings = hypothermia.

💎 **The Parkland formula is a starting point.** Titrate to urine output (0.5-1 mL/kg/hr).

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: The Kitchen Fire

**Patient:** 32-year-old female, grease fire, burns to both arms (circumferential) and anterior chest  
**Exam:** Blisters, red, moist, extremely painful  
**Vitals:** BP 142/88, HR 118, RR 22, SpO2 98% RA

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**TBSA:** 27% (arms 18% + anterior chest 9%)

**Treatment:**
- Burn center criteria met
- IV x2 large-bore
- Parkland formula: 4 x 60 x 27 = 6,480 mL / 24 hours
- Pain management (Morphine 2-4 mg IV)
- Dry sterile dressings
- Remove jewelry immediately

</details>

---

### Case 2: The Enclosed Space Fire

**Patient:** 58-year-old male, pulled from burning bedroom, confused, coughing black sputum  
**Exam:** Burns to face, singed eyebrows/nasal hairs, hoarse voice  
**Vitals:** BP 158/92, HR 128, RR 28, SpO2 94% on NRB

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Inhalation injury with impending airway compromise

**Action:**
- **Intubate NOW** - Don't wait for stridor
- Use large ETT (7.5-8.0)
- 100% O2
- Consider CO poisoning
- Burn center transport

## Reflection

✅ Classify burn depth (superficial, partial, full-thickness)  
✅ Estimate TBSA using Rule of Nines and Palm Method  
✅ Calculate Parkland formula for fluid resuscitation  
✅ Recognize inhalation injury and manage airway  
✅ Identify burn center criteria  

Burns are unforgiving. Learn them cold.
