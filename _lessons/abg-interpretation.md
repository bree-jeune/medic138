## Arrival Scenario

You're transporting a 68-year-old COPD patient from a community hospital. He's on BiPAP at 12/5, FiO2 50%, with decreased level of consciousness.

The ABG drawn 30 minutes ago:
- **pH:** 7.28
- **PaCO2:** 68 mmHg
- **PaO2:** 58 mmHg
- **HCO3:** 31 mEq/L

The nurse says "it's compensated respiratory acidosis."

**Your first thought should be:** Is this actually compensated? What does this mean for my transport plan?

## The Framework: ROME + Compensation

### Step 1: Look at the pH
- **pH < 7.35** → Acidosis
- **pH > 7.45** → Alkalosis
- **pH 7.35–7.45** → Normal (or fully compensated)

### Step 2: Determine Primary Problem (ROME)

**Respiratory Opposite, Metabolic Equal**

- **pH and CO2 opposite** → Respiratory problem
- **pH and HCO3 same direction** → Metabolic problem

### Step 3: Check Compensation

- **Respiratory problems** → kidneys compensate (24-48 hours)
- **Metabolic problems** → lungs compensate (minutes to hours)

**Compensation types:**
- **Uncompensated:** Only one value abnormal
- **Partial:** pH abnormal, other value helping
- **Full:** pH normal, both CO2 and HCO3 abnormal

## Normal Values

| Parameter | Normal Range |
|-----------|--------------|
| pH | 7.35 – 7.45 |
| PaCO2 | 35 – 45 mmHg |
| PaO2 | 80 – 100 mmHg |
| HCO3 | 22 – 26 mEq/L |

## Real-World Translation

**Respiratory Acidosis (pH ↓, CO2 ↑)**
- Not breathing enough
- Causes: COPD, overdose, neuromuscular weakness
- Fix: Improve ventilation

**Respiratory Alkalosis (pH ↑, CO2 ↓)**
- Breathing too much
- Causes: Anxiety, pain, hypoxia, PE, sepsis
- Fix: Treat underlying cause

**Metabolic Acidosis (pH ↓, HCO3 ↓)**
- Too much acid or lost too much base
- Causes: DKA, sepsis, lactic acidosis, renal failure
- Fix: Treat cause, consider bicarb if severe

**Metabolic Alkalosis (pH ↑, HCO3 ↑)**
- Lost acid or too much base
- Causes: Vomiting, diuretics, excessive bicarb
- Fix: Replace fluids/electrolytes

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Calling It "Compensated" When pH Is Abnormal
If pH is outside 7.35–7.45, it's NOT fully compensated.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Oxygenation
Perfect acid-base but PaO2 < 60? Still a problem.

### Mistake #3: Forgetting Mixed Disorders
Sometimes both respiratory AND metabolic problems exist.

### Mistake #4: Over-Trusting "Normal" pH
pH 7.38 with abnormal CO2 and HCO3 = full compensation (still significant).

## Clinical Pearls

💎 **pH drives everything.** If pH is wrong, patient is unstable.

💎 **CO2 is fast, kidneys are slow.** Respiratory compensation = minutes. Metabolic = days.

💎 **Chronic vs. Acute matters.** COPD patients live at CO2 60. Same number in overdose = disaster.

💎 **Lactate + low HCO3 = serious.** Think sepsis, shock, bowel ischemia.

💎 **If pH < 7.20, the patient is in trouble.** Period.

💎 **Know your patient.** ABG without clinical context is worthless.

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: The Anxious Patient

**Patient:** 34-year-old female, hyperventilating after panic attack  
**ABG:** pH 7.52, PaCO2 28, PaO2 110, HCO3 23

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Respiratory Alkalosis (uncompensated)

- pH ↑ (alkalosis)
- CO2 ↓ (respiratory cause)
- HCO3 normal (no compensation yet)

**Action:** Calm the patient, coach breathing.

</details>

---

### Case 2: The Septic Patient

**Patient:** 72-year-old male, septic shock, hypotensive  
**ABG:** pH 7.22, PaCO2 32, PaO2 68, HCO3 13, Lactate 6.8

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Metabolic Acidosis (partially compensated) with hypoxemia

- pH ↓ (acidosis)
- HCO3 ↓ (metabolic cause)
- CO2 ↓ (lungs compensating)
- High lactate = lactic acidosis

**Action:** Aggressive fluids, pressors, source control, optimize oxygenation.

</details>

---

### Case 3: The COPD Patient

**Patient:** 65-year-old COPD exacerbation, confused  
**ABG:** pH 7.24, PaCO2 72, PaO2 52, HCO3 30

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia

- pH dangerous at 7.24
- CO2 ↑ (likely chronic ~60, now acutely worse)
- HCO3 ↑ (kidneys have been compensating)

**Action:** BiPAP, consider intubation. **Do NOT hyperventilate** if you intubate—wean CO2 slowly.

</details>

---

### Case 4: The Diabetic

**Patient:** 28-year-old type 1 diabetic, Kussmaul respirations  
**ABG:** pH 7.18, PaCO2 22, PaO2 98, HCO3 8, Glucose 520

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Severe Metabolic Acidosis from DKA

- pH ↓ (severe)
- HCO3 ↓ (ketoacids)
- CO2 ↓ (Kussmaul = lung compensation)

**Action:** IV fluids, insulin drip, electrolyte monitoring, transport to ICU.

</details>

## Reflection

✅ Identify acidosis vs. alkalosis from pH  
✅ Determine respiratory or metabolic using ROME  
✅ Recognize partial vs. full compensation  
✅ Evaluate oxygenation status  
✅ Translate ABG findings into clinical actions  

ABGs aren't scary—they're just numbers telling you a story. Learn to speak the language.
