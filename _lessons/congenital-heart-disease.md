## Arrival Scenario

You're called to a pediatrician's office for a 3-week-old infant. The baby has been "fussy and not eating well" for 2 days. Mom says he "turns blue sometimes" during feeds.

On exam: pale, diaphoretic, tachypneic (RR 68), grunting, weak cry. Heart rate 185. Liver edge palpable 2 cm below costal margin. Weak femoral pulses. SpO2 82% on room air.

The pediatrician hands you a referral letter: "Suspected congenital heart disease - needs pediatric cardiology eval."

**This baby is in heart failure. And you need to know why.**

## Warm-Up Questions

Before we break down the anatomy, answer these:

1. What's the difference between cyanotic and acyanotic congenital heart disease?
2. What is a shunt? Left-to-right vs. right-to-left?
3. What are the signs of heart failure in an infant?
4. What is a duct-dependent lesion?
5. Why would a baby with certain heart defects NEED to stay hypoxic?

These aren't trivia. They're life-or-death concepts.

## Congenital Heart Disease Overview

**Congenital heart disease** = structural heart defect present at birth.

**Incidence:** ~1% of live births (most common congenital defect)

**Two main categories:**
1. **Acyanotic** (pink baby) - usually left-to-right shunts
2. **Cyanotic** (blue baby) - usually right-to-left shunts or mixing lesions

### Understanding Shunts

**Shunt** = abnormal connection allowing blood to bypass normal circulation

**Left-to-Right Shunt:**
- Blood flows from high-pressure left side → low-pressure right side
- **Result:** Too much blood goes to lungs (pulmonary overcirculation)
- **Presentation:** CHF symptoms, not cyanotic (until Eisenmenger syndrome develops)
- **Examples:** VSD, ASD, PDA

**Right-to-Left Shunt:**
- Blood flows from right side → left side, bypassing lungs
- **Result:** Deoxygenated blood enters systemic circulation
- **Presentation:** Cyanosis (blue baby)
- **Examples:** Tetralogy of Fallot, transposition, truncus arteriosus

---

## Acyanotic (Left-to-Right Shunt) Lesions

### Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)

**What it is:** Hole in the wall between ventricles

**Pathophysiology:**
- Left ventricle pressure > right ventricle pressure
- Blood shunts left → right
- Extra blood floods lungs → pulmonary overcirculation → CHF

**Presentation:**
- **Small VSD:** Loud holosystolic murmur, asymptomatic (often closes spontaneously)
- **Large VSD:** CHF symptoms (FTT, tachypnea, diaphoresis, hepatomegaly), frequent respiratory infections

**Management:**
- Small: Observation
- Large: Surgery (patch closure)
- Acute CHF: Diuretics, afterload reduction

### Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)

**What it is:** Hole in the wall between atria

**Pathophysiology:**
- Left atrium pressure > right atrium pressure
- Blood shunts left → right (less dramatic than VSD)
- Pulmonary overcirculation develops over time

**Presentation:**
- Often asymptomatic in childhood
- Fixed split S2 (classic finding)
- CHF symptoms in adulthood if uncorrected
- Increased risk of stroke (paradoxical embolism)

**Management:** Observation vs. surgical/catheter-based closure

### Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)

**What it is:** Ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth

**Normal physiology:** Ductus connects pulmonary artery to aorta in fetus, closes within days of birth

**Pathophysiology:**
- Aorta pressure > pulmonary artery pressure
- Blood shunts aorta → PA → floods lungs
- Increased pulmonary blood flow → CHF

**Presentation:**
- **Continuous "machinery" murmur** (systole + diastole)
- Bounding pulses (wide pulse pressure)
- CHF symptoms if large

**Management:**
- Indomethacin (closes duct in premature infants)
- Surgical ligation if medical management fails

---

## Cyanotic (Right-to-Left Shunt) Lesions

### Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)

**What it is:** Four defects occurring together

**The Four Defects:**
1. **VSD** (large)
2. **Pulmonary stenosis** (RV outflow obstruction)
3. **Overriding aorta** (aorta sits over VSD)
4. **Right ventricular hypertrophy** (compensatory)

**Pathophysiology:**
- Pulmonary stenosis → high RV pressure
- Blood shunts right → left through VSD
- Deoxygenated blood enters aorta → cyanosis

**Presentation:**
- Cyanosis (worse with crying, feeding, exertion)
- **Tet spells** (hypercyanotic episodes)
- Squatting after exertion (increases systemic resistance → more blood to lungs)
- "Boot-shaped" heart on CXR

**Tet Spell (Hypercyanotic Crisis):**
- Severe cyanosis, irritability, loss of consciousness
- Triggered by crying, defecation, feeding
- **Emergency:** Can lead to syncope, seizures, death

**Tet Spell Management:**
- Knee-chest position (increases SVR)
- 100% O2 (won't help much, but give it)
- IV fluids (increase preload)
- Morphine (decreases SVR, calms infant)
- Phenylephrine (increases SVR, controversial)

### Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA)

**What it is:** Aorta and pulmonary artery are switched

**Pathophysiology:**
- Aorta arises from RV (carries deoxygenated blood to body)
- PA arises from LV (carries oxygenated blood back to lungs)
- **Two separate circuits** - incompatible with life unless mixing occurs

**Survival depends on:**
- Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
- Atrial septal defect (ASD)
- Ventricular septal defect (VSD)

**Presentation:**
- Severe cyanosis within hours of birth
- Worsens as ductus closes
- **Duct-dependent lesion** - needs prostaglandin E1 to survive

**Management:**
- **Prostaglandin E1 infusion** (keeps ductus open)
- Balloon atrial septostomy (create/enlarge ASD for mixing)
- Arterial switch operation (definitive repair)

### Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS)

**What it is:** Left ventricle, mitral valve, aortic valve underdeveloped/absent

**Pathophysiology:**
- RV must supply both pulmonary and systemic circulation
- Systemic blood flow depends on PDA (duct-dependent)
- Mixing occurs at atrial level

**Presentation:**
- Appears normal at birth (ductus is open)
- Rapid deterioration as ductus closes (12-48 hours)
- Shock, cyanosis, respiratory distress
- Weak/absent pulses
- Gray, mottled skin

**Management:**
- **Prostaglandin E1 immediately** (keeps duct open - this baby will die without it)
- IV fluids cautiously (preload management)
- Avoid high FiO2 (causes pulmonary vasodilation → steals blood from systemic circulation)
- Immediate transport to pediatric cardiac center
- Norwood procedure (3-stage surgical palliation) or transplant

### Truncus Arteriosus

**What it is:** Single arterial trunk arises from heart (instead of separate aorta + PA)

**Pathophysiology:**
- Complete mixing of oxygenated + deoxygenated blood
- Always has VSD
- Pulmonary overcirculation (CHF) + mild cyanosis

**Presentation:**
- Cyanosis + CHF symptoms
- Loud systolic murmur
- Bounding pulses

**Management:**
- CHF management
- Surgical repair

---

## Duct-Dependent Lesions

Certain lesions require the ductus arteriosus to remain open for survival:

**Duct-Dependent for Systemic Flow:**
- Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
- Critical aortic stenosis
- Interrupted aortic arch
- Coarctation of the aorta (severe)

**Duct-Dependent for Pulmonary Flow:**
- Pulmonary atresia
- Critical pulmonary stenosis
- Tricuspid atresia

**If the duct closes → the baby dies.**

**Treatment:** **Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)** keeps the ductus open

**PGE1 Dosing:** 0.05-0.1 mcg/kg/min IV infusion

**Side Effects:** Apnea (have intubation equipment ready), hypotension, fever

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Giving High-Flow O2 to All Cyanotic Babies
In duct-dependent systemic lesions (like HLHS), high O2 causes pulmonary vasodilation → more blood to lungs → less blood to body → worsens shock. Keep SpO2 75-85%.

### Mistake #2: Missing the Diagnosis Because "Baby Looks Fine"
Many CHD babies compensate well initially. Then they crash suddenly when the ductus closes.

### Mistake #3: Treating "Pneumonia" in a Baby with Undiagnosed CHD
CHF looks like pneumonia (tachypnea, crackles, poor feeding). Don't assume it's infection.

### Mistake #4: Aggressive Fluid Resuscitation in CHF
These babies are in fluid overload, not dehydration. Fluids can worsen CHF.

### Mistake #5: Delaying Transport for "Stabilization"
Duct-dependent lesions need PGE1 and pediatric cardiac surgery. Get moving.

## Clinical Pearls

💎 **Cyanosis that doesn't improve with O2 = cardiac problem until proven otherwise.**

💎 **Differential cyanosis (pink upper body, blue lower body) = think coarctation or interrupted aortic arch.**

💎 **Reverse differential cyanosis (blue upper, pink lower) = think transposition with PDA.**

💎 **Absent or weak femoral pulses in a neonate = coarctation of the aorta.**

💎 **If a baby crashes at 2-7 days of life = think duct-dependent lesion (ductus is closing).**

💎 **Tet spell = knee-chest position + O2 + fluids + morphine.**

💎 **HLHS babies can't tolerate high O2.** Keep SpO2 75-85% (counterintuitive but critical).

💎 **A loud murmur doesn't always mean severe disease.** Small VSDs are loud. Large VSDs with CHF may have soft murmurs.

💎 **Diaphoresis during feeding in an infant = heart failure.**

💎 **If you suspect duct-dependent CHD, call for PGE1 early.** Don't wait for the crash.

## Decision Trees

### Cyanotic Newborn Assessment

```
Cyanotic Newborn
    ↓
Give 100% O2
    ↓
Cyanosis improves?
    YES → Likely respiratory cause
        - Pneumonia, TTN, RDS, meconium aspiration
        - Continue respiratory support
    NO → Likely cardiac cause (or severe lung disease)
        ↓
        Check pulses (all 4 extremities)
        ↓
        Weak/absent femoral pulses?
            YES → Coarctation, interrupted arch, HLHS
            NO → Continue assessment
        ↓
        Differential cyanosis?
            YES → Coarctation with PDA
        ↓
        Signs of CHF? (tachypnea, hepatomegaly, poor feeding)
            YES → Mixing lesion (TGA, truncus, TAPVR)
        ↓
        Suspect duct-dependent lesion?
            ↓
            Contact pediatric cardiology
            Prepare PGE1 infusion
            Intubation equipment ready
            Immediate transport to cardiac center
```

### Duct-Dependent Lesion Management

```
Suspected Duct-Dependent CHD
    ↓
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
    ↓
1. Contact pediatric cardiac center
2. Request PGE1 (if available)
3. Prepare for potential apnea (intubation equipment)
4. IV access (IO if difficult)
    ↓
Is PGE1 Available?
    YES → Start PGE1 infusion
        - Dose: 0.05-0.1 mcg/kg/min
        - Monitor for apnea
        - Intubate if apnea occurs
    NO → Supportive care during transport
        - Minimize O2 if HLHS suspected
        - IV fluids cautiously
        - Keep baby warm
        - Rapid transport
    ↓
Oxygen Management Based on Lesion:
    ↓
    Duct-dependent for SYSTEMIC flow (HLHS)?
        → Keep SpO2 75-85%
        → Avoid high O2 (worsens shock)
    ↓
    Duct-dependent for PULMONARY flow (PA, PS)?
        → Give O2 as needed
        → Higher SpO2 okay
    ↓
Transport with continuous monitoring
Anticipate deterioration
```

## Practice Cases

### Case 1: The Blue Baby

**Patient:** 12-hour-old male, full-term, was pink at birth, now blue  
**Exam:** Cyanotic, RR 60, HR 170, SpO2 78% RA → 82% on 100% O2  
**Pulses:** Strong and equal all extremities  

**What's your leading diagnosis?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Likely Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA)

**Why:**
- Cyanosis within first day of life
- Minimal improvement with O2 (cardiac shunt)
- Timing (ductus starting to close)
- Strong pulses (not a systemic flow problem)

**Action:**
- **Immediate transport to pediatric cardiac center**
- **Request PGE1** (this baby needs it NOW)
- Prepare for intubation (PGE1 causes apnea)
- IV access
- Keep warm
- Continuous monitoring
- Contact neonatology/cardiology en route

**This baby needs a balloon atrial septostomy and will require arterial switch surgery.**

</details>

### Case 2: The Fussy Feeder

**Patient:** 3-week-old female, poor weight gain, sweaty during feeds, fast breathing  
**Exam:** Tachypneic (RR 68), diaphoretic, hepatomegaly, loud holosystolic murmur at LLSB  
**Vitals:** HR 185, SpO2 97% RA  
**Pulses:** Strong

**What's the problem?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Congestive Heart Failure from large VSD

**Why:**
- Classic CHF symptoms in infant:
  - Diaphoresis during feeds (increased work)
  - Tachypnea, tachycardia
  - Poor weight gain (using all calories for breathing/pumping)
  - Hepatomegaly (fluid backup)
- Loud holosystolic murmur at LLSB = VSD
- NOT cyanotic (left-to-right shunt, pink baby)

**Action:**
- **Sit upright** (ease work of breathing)
- **Oxygen** (decrease pulmonary vascular resistance)
- **IV access**
- **Transport to pediatric cardiology**
- Consider diuretics if ordered (Lasix)
- Minimize stress (keep calm, let parent hold if stable)

**This baby will need surgical VSD closure.**

</details>

### Case 3: The Tet Spell

**Patient:** 6-month-old male, known Tetralogy of Fallot, awaiting repair  
**Event:** Mom called 911 because baby turned "dark blue" and went limp during diaper change  
**Current:** Deeply cyanotic, lethargic, RR 80, HR 210, SpO2 60%

**What do you do?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** This is a hypercyanotic (Tet) spell - needs immediate intervention

**Action:**
- **Knee-chest position** (increases SVR → more blood to lungs)
- **100% O2** (won't fix shunt but give it anyway)
- **IV access** (IO if difficult)
- **IV fluid bolus** (10-20 mL/kg NS - increases preload)
- **Morphine** 0.1 mg/kg IV (reduces SVR, calms baby)
- **Keep calm** (crying worsens spell)
- **Consider phenylephrine** if profound hypotension (increases SVR)

**Transport to pediatric cardiac center**

**If baby arrests:**
- CPR
- Intubate
- Continue knee-chest if possible
- Bicarb for acidosis
- This is a surgical emergency

**Tet spells can be fatal. Aggressive management required.**

</details>

### Case 4: The Crashing Neonate

**Patient:** 5-day-old male, born at home, now limp and gray  
**History:** Was fine for first 3 days, then stopped eating, became progressively more lethargic  
**Exam:** Gray, mottled, weak cry, RR 70, HR 220, weak pulses throughout, SpO2 75% on 100% O2  
**Liver:** Palpable 3 cm below costal margin

**What's happening?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Duct-dependent systemic lesion (likely HLHS) with ductal closure → cardiogenic shock

**Why:**
- Timing: 3-7 days of life (ductus closes)
- Was fine initially (duct was open)
- Rapid deterioration (systemic circulation failing)
- Weak pulses (poor systemic perfusion)
- Doesn't respond to O2 (cardiac problem)
- Hepatomegaly (backward heart failure)

**Action:**
- **CALL FOR PGE1 IMMEDIATELY** (life-saving)
- **IV/IO access**
- **Cautious fluid bolus** (5-10 mL/kg max - these babies are in CHF)
- **Reduce FiO2 to keep SpO2 75-85%** (counterintuitive but critical)
  - High O2 → pulmonary vasodilation → blood steals from systemic circulation
- **Intubation equipment ready** (PGE1 causes apnea)
- **Emergent transport to pediatric cardiac center**
- **Inotropic support** if ordered (dopamine, dobutamine)

**Without PGE1 and immediate surgical intervention, this baby will die.**

</details>

### Case 5: The Older Child

**Patient:** 4-year-old male, squatting after running, moderately cyanotic  
**History:** Known "heart problem," awaiting surgery  
**Exam:** Blue lips/nailbeds, RR 32, HR 145, SpO2 88% RA  
**Parent:** "He always squats when he's tired. Doctors say it helps."

**What condition does he likely have?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer:** Tetralogy of Fallot (unrepaired)

**Why:**
- Squatting is pathognomonic for TOF
- Squatting increases systemic vascular resistance
- This forces more blood through the pulmonary stenosis → more oxygenated blood
- Decreases right-to-left shunt
- Children learn this instinctively

**Action:**
- **Allow squatting** (it's therapeutic)
- Oxygen
- Keep calm
- Transport for cardiac evaluation/surgery
- If Tet spell develops → manage as above

**These kids need surgical repair (complete correction) before school age.**

</details>

## Reflection

Congenital heart disease is complex, but pattern recognition saves lives.

Here's what you should know:

✅ Difference between cyanotic and acyanotic lesions  
✅ Left-to-right shunts cause CHF (VSD, ASD, PDA)  
✅ Right-to-left shunts cause cyanosis (TOF, TGA, truncus)  
✅ Duct-dependent lesions need PGE1 to survive  
✅ Tet spells require knee-chest + O2 + fluids + morphine  
✅ HLHS babies can't tolerate high O2 (keep SpO2 75-85%)  
✅ Timing matters: deterioration at 3-7 days = think closing ductus  

**Next-level thinking:**
- How do you differentiate respiratory vs. cardiac cyanosis?
- What's Eisenmenger syndrome and why does it matter?
- How do surgical repairs change hemodynamics?
- What are the long-term complications of CHD repairs?

**Your assignment:**  
Read up on PGE1 protocols in your system. Know where to find it, how to mix it, and when to call for it. One day, you'll transport a duct-dependent baby—and knowing this cold will save their life.

CHD is scary. But it's manageable if you understand the physiology.
