  <h1>Medic 138</h1>
  <p>Medic 138 is a street-level EMS education project.</p>

  <p>It exists for three groups:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>EMT students who feel lost in PowerPoints</li>
    <li>Paramedic students who want pattern recognition, not trivia</li>
    <li>Working medics who still care enough to get better between calls</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Lessons are short, scenario-based, and built for real shifts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Warm-up scenario to set the scene</li>
    <li>Core explanation in plain language</li>
    <li>Interactive quiz, case, or game</li>
    <li>Cheat sheet you can screenshot and reference later</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Everything here is built by a working paramedic and instructor who still remembers what it feels like to be new.</p>
